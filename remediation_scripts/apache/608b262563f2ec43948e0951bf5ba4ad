####patch script to remediate  CVE-2018-15473 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2018-15473 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then
  # Stop Apache
  echo "Stopping Apache..."
  sudo systemctl stop httpd

  # Apply the patch
  echo "Applying patch..."
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2018-15473.patch

  # Restart Apache
  echo "Restarting Apache..."
  sudo systemctl start httpd

  # Check if the patch was applied successfully
  if [ $(grep -q "CVE-2018-15473" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) ]; then
    echo "Patch applied successfully!"
  else
    echo "Patch failed to apply!"
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will stop Apache, apply the patch, and then restart Apache. The script will then check if the patch was applied successfully. If it was, the script will print "Patch applied successfully!". Otherwise, the script will print "Patch failed to apply!" and exit with an error code of 1.

Please note that this is just a sample script and may need to be modified to work on your specific system.
