Injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web application's inputs, such as form fields, HTTP headers, and database queries. This code can then be executed by the application, which can lead to a variety of attacks.

To protect your web applications from injection vulnerabilities, you should:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Use an input encoder to encode all user input before it is displayed on the web page.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your application from common injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing XSS attacks:

* Encode all output before displaying it on the web page.
* Use a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the types of scripts that can be executed on your web pages.
* Use a JavaScript library that sanitizes user input before it is used in JavaScript code.
* Keep your web application software up to date and apply security patches promptly.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection vulnerabilities and other security risks.
