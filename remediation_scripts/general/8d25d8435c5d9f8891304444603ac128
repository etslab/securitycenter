####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 cipherlist OBSOLETED, offered in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 cipherlist OBSOLETED, offered in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if ! pgrep httpd >/dev/null; then
  echo "Apache is not running. Exiting."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the current cipherlist
cipherlist=$(apachectl -t -DSHOW_CIPHERS)

# Check if the OBSOLETED ciphers are in the list
if [[ $cipherlist =~ OBSOLETED ]]; then
  # Remove the OBSOLETED ciphers from the list
  cipherlist=${cipherlist//OBSOLETED/}

  # Update the cipherlist in Apache
  apachectl -t -DSSL_CIPHERS=$cipherlist

  echo "Successfully patched Apache to remove the OBSOLETED ciphers."
else
  echo "The OBSOLETED ciphers are not in the cipherlist. No action required."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the current cipherlist that Apache is using. The script will then check if the OBSOLETED ciphers are in the list. If they are, the script will remove them from the list and update the cipherlist in Apache. Finally, the script will print a message indicating whether or not the patch was successful.

Please note that this is just a sample script and may need to be modified to work with your specific Apache configuration.
