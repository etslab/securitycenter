###How to fix the Certificates issue of cipherlist AVERAGE, offered
To fix the Certificates issue of cipherlist AVERAGE, offered in apache web server, you can do the following:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file.
2. Find the line that starts with `SSLCipherSuite`.
3. Change the value of the `SSLCipherSuite` directive to a more secure cipherlist.
4. Restart the Apache web server.

The following is an example of a secure cipherlist:


SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:kEDH+AESGCM:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-SHA256:AES128-SHA256:AES:CAMELLIA:DES-CBC3-SHA:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!RC4:!MD5:!PSK:!aECDH:!EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA:!EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:!KRB5-DES-CBC3-SHA


This cipherlist includes a variety of ciphers that are considered to be secure. It also excludes ciphers that are known to be insecure or that are not supported by all browsers.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is A1: Injection. Insecure ciphers can allow attackers to inject malicious code into a web application, which can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities.
