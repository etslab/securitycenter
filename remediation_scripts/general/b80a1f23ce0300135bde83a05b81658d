####patch script to remediate  CVE-2021-44224 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2021-44224 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(pgrep httpd) ]]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  httpd_version=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is vulnerable, patch it
  if [[ $httpd_version -lt 2.4.52 ]]; then
    echo "Patching Apache HTTP Server..."
    echo "Downloading patch..."
    wget https://downloads.apache.org/httpd/source/patches/2.4/CVE-2021-44224.patch
    echo "Applying patch..."
    patch -p1 < CVE-2021-44224.patch
    echo "Restarting Apache..."
    systemctl restart httpd
  else
    echo "Apache is not vulnerable."
  fi

else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This patch script will download the patch for CVE-2021-44224 from the Apache HTTP Server website, apply the patch, and restart Apache. If Apache is not running, the script will print a message stating that Apache is not running.

Please note that this is just an example patch script. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment.
