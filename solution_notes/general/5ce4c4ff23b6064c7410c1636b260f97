**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control (B1)

**Solution:**

1. Open Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard`
3. Check if the `RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures` value exists. If not, create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures`.
4. Set the value data to `1`.

**Additional Notes:**

This policy setting requires all remote access protocols to use platform security features such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS), Secure Boot, and Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI). By enabling this setting, you can improve the security of your server by preventing unauthorized access and protecting against malware attacks.

**Impact:**

If this policy is not enabled, remote access protocols may be more vulnerable to attacks. Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in these protocols to gain unauthorized access to your server.
