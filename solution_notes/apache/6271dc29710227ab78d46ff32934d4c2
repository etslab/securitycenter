###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2019-0211
CVE-2019-0211 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38. It allows an attacker with read/write access to a worker process to manipulate the scoreboard to point to a rogue worker before an Apache graceful restart is initiated by logrotate. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root).

To fix this vulnerability, you should update your Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.39 or later. You can also apply the following workaround:

1. Edit the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`) and add the following line:

```
ScoreboardFile /var/run/apache2/scoreboard
```

2. Restart Apache.

This workaround will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited, but it will also prevent Apache from using the scoreboard to track the status of worker processes. This may result in a performance impact.

CVE-2019-0211 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Security Risks 2021 category of **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to hide their activity or prevent detection of their attacks. By logging and monitoring system activity, you can identify suspicious activity and take steps to prevent attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing CVE-2019-0211 and other privilege escalation vulnerabilities:

* Keep your software up to date. Software vendors often release security updates to fix vulnerabilities. By keeping your software up to date, you can help to protect your systems from attack.
* Use strong passwords and security practices. Strong passwords and security practices can help to prevent attackers from gaining access to your systems in the first place.
* Monitor your systems for suspicious activity. By monitoring your systems for suspicious activity, you can identify attacks early and take steps to prevent them from succeeding.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your systems from CVE-2019-0211 and other privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
