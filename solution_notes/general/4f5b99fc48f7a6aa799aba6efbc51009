**Solution:**

To fix this issue, update your Apache configuration to disable TLS CBC ciphers. Here's a sample configuration:

```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLCipherSuite !aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!RC4:!3DES:!TLS_SRP:!TLS_PSK:!PSK
```

You can also use the following steps:

1. Open the Apache configuration file (usually located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
2. Add the following line to the file:

```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
```

3. Add the following line to the file:

```
SSLCipherSuite !aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!DES:!MD5:!RC4:!3DES:!TLS_SRP:!TLS_PSK:!PSK
```

4. Save the file and restart Apache.

This fix addresses the issue by disabling TLS CBC ciphers, which are considered insecure and can be exploited by attackers.
