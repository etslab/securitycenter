###How to fix the Certificates issue of Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely. This includes unsafe-inline or data: inside script-src overly broad sources such as https: inside object-src or script-src or not restricting the sources for object-src or script-src.
There are a few things you can do to fix the Certificates issue of Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely in Apache web server.

* **Use a more restrictive `script-src` directive.** The `script-src` directive specifies the sources from which scripts can be loaded. By default, it allows scripts from any source. However, this can be a security risk, as it allows attackers to inject malicious code into your website. To mitigate this risk, you should use a more restrictive `script-src` directive that only allows scripts from trusted sources.
* **Remove the `unsafe-inline` directive.** The `unsafe-inline` directive allows inline scripts to be executed. This can be a security risk, as it allows attackers to inject malicious code into your website. To mitigate this risk, you should remove the `unsafe-inline` directive.
* **Remove the `data:` protocol from the `script-src` directive.** The `data:` protocol allows scripts to be loaded from data URIs. This can be a security risk, as it allows attackers to inject malicious code into your website. To mitigate this risk, you should remove the `data:` protocol from the `script-src` directive.

Once you have made these changes, you should restart your Apache web server.

The Certificates issue of Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely belongs to the **Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. This category includes risks that allow attackers to inject malicious code into a web application. By injecting malicious code, attackers can gain control of the application and steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

By following the steps above, you can help to mitigate the risk of Injection attacks on your website.
