**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Authentication

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to update the list of trusted keys used by apt-key to verify package authenticity. This can be done by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-key update
```

After running this command, you should restart your web server (Apache in this case) as follows:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

**Additional Mitigation:**

* Use a package manager that supports key pinning to ensure that packages are only installed from trusted sources.
* Regularly review the list of trusted keys and remove any that are no longer needed.
* Use a security scanner to identify vulnerabilities in your system, including outdated software or weak authentication mechanisms.
