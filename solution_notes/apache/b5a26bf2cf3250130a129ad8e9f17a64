**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify Vulnerable Input Sources:** Review server logs and codebase to find any input sources that may contain NUL characters. Input sources include HTTP request parameters, form data, cookies, and HTTP headers.
2. **Sanitize Input:** Implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to remove or neutralize NUL characters. Use libraries or regular expressions to perform the following sanitization:
   - Remove NUL characters outright.
   - Replace NUL characters with a safe character, such as a space or hyphen.
   - Encode NUL characters using a web-safe encoding, such as URL encoding or HTML encoding.
3. **Use Strong Type Checking:** Implement strong type checking in the codebase to ensure that input is received in the expected data type and that NUL characters cannot be passed through inadvertently.
4. **Monitor and Test:** Regularly monitor the server for suspicious activity and conduct security testing to verify that the solution is effective.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Implement input size limits to prevent buffer overflows that could allow attackers to inject NUL characters.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out requests containing NUL characters before they reach the server.
* Train developers on the importance of input sanitization and how to implement it effectively.
* Consider using a dependency scanning tool to identify any vulnerable libraries or components that may introduce NUL character vulnerabilities.
