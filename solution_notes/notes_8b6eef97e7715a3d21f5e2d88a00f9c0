**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A6 - Configuration Issues

**Solution:**

1. Go to the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile`.
3. Find the `DefaultInboundAction` value in the right pane.
4. Double-click on `DefaultInboundAction` and set the value data to `0` (Deny All).

**Explanation:**

Policy DefaultInboundAction specifies the default action that the Windows Firewall should take when it encounters an inbound network connection that does not match any rule. A value of '1' (Allow All) allows all inbound connections, which significantly increases the attack surface of the system. Setting the value to '0' (Deny All) blocks all inbound connections, providing a more secure configuration.

This issue falls under OWASP Top 10 2021 Category A6 - Configuration Issues, as it relates to the insecure configuration of the Windows Firewall. By setting the DefaultInboundAction to 'Allow All', the server is more vulnerable to network attacks.
