**Severity:** High

**SonarQube Rule:** php:S1784

**Definition:** A new instance of a built-in class is created and immediately assigned to a property.

**Impact:**
* Unnecessary object creation
* Potential performance issues

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not directly related to any specific OWASP category.

**Solution:**
Replace the problematic code with a single statement:

```php
$this->property = new SomeClass();
```

**Example:**

```php
// Problematic code
$myClass = new SomeClass();
$this->property = $myClass;

// Improved code
$this->property = new SomeClass();
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a dependency injection container to manage object creation and dependency resolution.
* Consider using immutable objects where possible to avoid unnecessary object creation.
* Implement a caching mechanism to reuse frequently created objects.
