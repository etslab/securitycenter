**Severity: High**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Assessment:**

The Policy EnableFirewall registry value controls whether the Windows Firewall is enabled or not. If this value is set to 0, the firewall will be disabled, allowing unauthorized access to the system. This issue is considered high severity as it potentially exposes the web server to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, data theft, and denial of service.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile`
3. Locate the "EnableFirewall" value.
4. If the value is set to 0, double-click on it and change it to 1.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting should be applied to all servers in the domain.
* It is recommended to use a group policy to manage this setting for multiple servers.
* You should also review other Windows Firewall settings to ensure they are configured securely.
