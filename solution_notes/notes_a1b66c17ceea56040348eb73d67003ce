**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Verify the Issue:** Check if the file 'apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libtacrashclone.so' is actually present in the Apache server directory. If not, the issue may be a false positive.

2. **Remove the File:** If the file is present, delete it from the Apache server directory. It is not a necessary component and does not impact the functionality of the server.

3. **Check Permissions:** Verify that the Apache server directory has the correct permissions set. It should be owned by the Apache user and have restricted write permissions for other users.

4. **Update Apache:** Ensure that you are running the latest version of Apache. Regular updates include security fixes that may address this type of issue.

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help prevent malicious requests from reaching the Apache server, protecting it from potential attacks.

2. **Configure Secure Headers:** Implement secure headers such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent malicious scripts from executing.

3. **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review Apache server logs for any suspicious activity or error messages that may indicate a compromise.

4. **Consider Using a Vulnerability Scanner:** Utilize a vulnerability scanner to periodically check for security issues and misconfigurations in your Apache server environment.
