**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Logging and Monitoring Flaws

**Solution:**

**1. Configure Registry Policy:**

* Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging
```
* Right-click and create a new DWORD value named "LogFileSize".
* Set the value of "LogFileSize" to 10240 (10 MB) or as per your organization's policy.

**2. Restart Firewall Service:**

* Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as administrator.
* Run the following command:
```
net stop mpsdrv
net start mpsdrv
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

* The Policy LogFileSize registry entry controls the maximum size (in bytes) of the Windows Firewall log file.
* A large log file can consume excessive disk space and slow down performance.
* Setting a reasonable LogFileSize limit ensures that the log file remains manageable and does not hinder the server's operation.

**Impact on OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:**

* Logging and Monitoring Flaws: Failure to properly configure logging can lead to incomplete or inaccurate logging data, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents.
