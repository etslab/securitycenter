**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Injection

**Description:**

The Policy DriverLoadPolicy registry setting in `EarlyLaunch` determines whether or not the system loads unsigned drivers. By default, this setting is disabled, preventing the loading of unsigned drivers. However, if this setting is changed to "1" (enabled), it allows unsigned drivers to be loaded, which can lead to kernel-level vulnerabilities and potential code execution.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, ensure that the `Policy DriverLoadPolicy` registry setting in `EarlyLaunch` is set to "0" (disabled). This can be done using the following steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\EarlyLaunch
    ```
3. Double-click the `DriverLoadPolicy` value.
4. Change the value data to "0" (disabled).
5. Click OK to save your changes.
6. Restart the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is addressed by Microsoft in the following security bulletin: [MS16-076](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2016/ms16-076)
* It is important to note that disabling the loading of unsigned drivers may affect the functionality of certain hardware devices. Therefore, it is recommended to test the system after making this change to ensure that all necessary devices are functioning properly.
