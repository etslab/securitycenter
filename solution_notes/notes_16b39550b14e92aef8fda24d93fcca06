**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** XML External Entities (XXE) (A8)

**Detailed Solution:**

This issue is caused by a vulnerability in the `encoding/xml` package in Go, which can lead to stack exhaustion during XML parsing. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XML document that contains a large number of nested elements.

To fix this issue, upgrade to the latest version of Go (1.18 or later) and use the `encoding/xml#Decoder.DisallowDTD` option to disable the processing of DTDs (Document Type Definitions).

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. **Update Go Version:** Upgrade to the latest version of Go (1.18 or later).
2. **Disable DTD Processing:** Add the following code to your application to disable the processing of DTDs:

```go
decoder := xml.NewDecoder(r)
decoder.DisallowDTD = true
```

3. **Validate XML Input:** Validate XML input to ensure that it conforms to expected schemas and does not contain malicious content.
4. **Set Input Limits:** Limit the size and complexity of XML input to prevent potential resource exhaustion attacks.
5. **Use a Firewall/WAF:** Implement a firewall or Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious XML requests before they reach the application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `encoding/xml#Decoder.DisallowDTD` option is only available in Go 1.18 and later.
* Disabling DTDs can affect the functionality of applications that rely on DTDs for validation or other purposes.
* Consider using an XML library that includes built-in protections against XXE attacks, such as `github.com/beevik/etree`.
