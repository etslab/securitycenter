**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Upgrade Apache HTTP Server:** Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.34 or later, which addresses this vulnerability.

2. **Disable HTTP Trace Method:** Disable the HTTP Trace method by adding the following directive to the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf):

```
TraceEnable off
```

3. **Restrict Access to TRACE Header:** Implement restrictions to prevent clients from sending HTTP TRACE requests:

- Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block TRACE requests.
- Configure web applications to reject requests with the TRACE header.

4. **Enable mod_security with IDS rules:** Install and enable the mod_security module with appropriate rules to detect and block malicious TRACE requests.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Periodically review Apache documentation for security updates.
* Implement a security patching process to promptly apply security updates.
* Regularly audit Apache configurations to ensure they are secure.
