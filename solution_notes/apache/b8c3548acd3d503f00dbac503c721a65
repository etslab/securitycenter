**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Insecure Design

**Description:**

The `android_sha1` is a script present in Apache web servers that is used to map the Android package name to a SHA1 hash of the certificate. However, this script is insecure and vulnerable to attack. It allows attackers to bypass security features and obtain sensitive information from the server.

**Solution:**

Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1. Remove the `android_sha1` script from the server.
2. Update the `.htaccess` file to remove any references to the `android_sha1` script.
3. Restart the Apache web server.

**Note:** You should also consider implementing additional security measures to protect your server from other vulnerabilities. This may include implementing a web application firewall (WAF) or using a security scanner to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
