# Security Center
Solution Center for Web Application Firewall

eCyWAF is an open Web Application Firewall intiative for web application owners to protect their applications from the web security threats and vulnerabilities. If you decide that a preconfigured rule matches more traffic than is necessary, or if the rule is blocking traffic that needs to be allowed, the rule can be disabled from Security Center or eCyWAF config files. Deploying a Docker container firewall is simple, and even adds cloud and host security protections.
