**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Registry Key:** Determine the specific registry key being managed by the Apache server. This key may be related to user account settings, authentication, or other security-related configurations.

2. **Restrict Write Access:** Grant write permissions to the registry key only to administrators or a trusted group of users. This prevents unauthorized modifications to the user account settings.

3. **Implement Registry Auditing:** Enable auditing for the registry key to monitor any changes made by users. Use the "regaudit" utility or other audit tools to track and review registry modifications.

4. **Use Encrypted Passwords:** Store user passwords in encrypted format within the registry. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information if the registry is compromised.

5. **Configure Password Complexity:** Enforce a strong password policy that requires complex passwords, minimum length, special characters, and regular updates.

6. **Limit Failed Login Attempts:** Implement a lockout mechanism to limit the number of failed login attempts to the registry key. This prevents brute-force attacks against user accounts.

7. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:** Consider implementing two-factor authentication for accessing the registry key. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor, such as a code sent via SMS or email.

8. **Regularly Review Registry Settings:** Periodically review the registry key settings to ensure that they are still valid and in accordance with security best practices.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a dedicated security solution or tool to monitor and detect suspicious activity related to registry account management.
* Regularly patch and update the Apache server and its components to address known vulnerabilities.
* Implement a comprehensive security awareness program for all users to emphasize the importance of following security guidelines.
