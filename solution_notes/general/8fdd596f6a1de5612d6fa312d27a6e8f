**Detailed Solution**:

1. **Enable Directory Service Replication Policy in Registry DS Access**:
   - Ensure that the "Directory Service Replication" policy is enabled in Registry DS Access. This policy controls access to replication operations, preventing unauthorized users from modifying or deleting critical data.

2. **Disable Anonymous Bindings**:
   - Disable anonymous bindings to the directory service. Anonymous bindings allow users to access the directory service without providing credentials, which can lead to unauthorized access.

3. **Restrict Access to Replication Objects**:
   - Restrict access to replication objects (e.g., replication controllers, connections, and bridgeheads) to authorized administrators only. This ensures that only trusted individuals can configure and manage replication operations.

4. **Use Secure Channels for Replication**:
   - Use secure communication channels (e.g., LDAP over SSL/TLS) for directory service replication. This prevents unauthorized access to replicated data while in transit.

5. **Monitor Replication Activity**:
   - Monitor replication activity regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized changes. This allows you to detect and respond to any potential security breaches promptly.

**Additional Considerations**:

* Review and update the directory service access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit the privileges of different user roles.
* Regularly audit the directory service configuration and access logs to identify any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
