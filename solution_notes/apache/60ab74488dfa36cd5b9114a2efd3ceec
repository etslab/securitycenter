**Severity:** Medium

**Solution:**

1. Review the commented-out code and determine if it is still needed.
2. If the commented-out code is no longer needed, delete it.
3. If the commented-out code is still needed, move it to a separate file or method.
4. Ensure that the commented-out code is not executed by accident, such as by using a preprocessor directive.

**Steps to Fix the Issue:**

1. Identify the commented-out code in the file `bWAPP/admin/index.php`.
2. Determine if the commented-out code is still needed.
3. If the commented-out code is no longer needed, delete it.
4. If the commented-out code is still needed, move it to a separate file or method.
5. If the commented-out code is moved to a separate file or method, ensure that it is not executed by accident.

**Example of a Fix:**

```php
// Commented-out code that is no longer needed
// echo "This code is no longer needed";

// Code that is still needed
echo "This code is still needed";
```

By removing or isolating the commented-out code, you can reduce the risk of it being executed by accident and causing a vulnerability.
