Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an application. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive data.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Sanitize all user input before it is used in an application.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect against XSS attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks.
