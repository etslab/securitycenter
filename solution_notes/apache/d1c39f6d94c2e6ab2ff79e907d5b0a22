The CVE-2019-10082 vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of A1 - Injection. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting, occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an application. This can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service.

To prevent injection attacks, you should always validate and sanitize all input data before sending it to an application. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from common injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements in SQL queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Use input encoding to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
* Use a WAF to help protect your application from common injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help protect your application from injection attacks.
