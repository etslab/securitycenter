**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Review and Tighten Registry Permissions:**
   - Identify all users and groups that have access to the Policy Registry.
   - Remove any unnecessary permissions or grant only the minimum privileges required.
2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
   - Create roles with specific permissions and assign them to users and groups.
   - This allows for finer-grained access control and reduces the risk of unauthorized modification.
3. **Enable Auditing:**
   - Configure Windows Event Logs to audit access attempts to the Policy Registry.
   - This will provide visibility into any suspicious activity and aid in incident response.
4. **Use Secure Communication:**
   - Ensure that registry access is protected using secure communication channels such as HTTPS.
   - This prevents eavesdropping and data manipulation.
5. **Implement Network Segmentation:**
   - Place the servers that host the Policy Registry on a separate network segment.
   - This limits the exposure of the registry to potential attackers.
6. **Keep Software Updated:**
   - Regularly update Windows and any registry-related software to patch potential vulnerabilities.
   - This reduces the risk of exploits that could grant unauthorized access to the registry.
7. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Deploy a WAF to filter out malicious requests targeting the Policy Registry.
   - This can help to block attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
