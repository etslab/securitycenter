####patch script to remediate  cert revocation, Neither CRL nor OCSP URI provided in Apache HTTP Server
Here is a patch script to remediate cert revocation, Neither CRL nor OCSP URI provided in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current Apache configuration
  config=$(apachectl -t -D DUMP_CONFIG)

  # Check if CRL or OCSP URI is configured
  if ! [[ $config =~ ^SSLCARevocationPath|^SSLCARevocationFile ]]; then

    # Add CRL or OCSP URI to the configuration
    echo "SSLCARevocationPath /etc/ssl/crl" >> $config

    # Reload Apache
    apachectl -t && apachectl -k graceful

  fi

else

  # Apache is not running, no need to remediate
  echo "Apache is not running, no need to remediate"

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current Apache configuration. The script will then check if CRL or OCSP URI is configured. If it is not, the script will add CRL or OCSP URI to the configuration. Finally, the script will reload Apache.

It is important to note that this patch script is just an example. The specific steps required to remediate cert revocation may vary depending on the specific Apache configuration.
