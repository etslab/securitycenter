####patch script to remediate  CVE-2022-29404 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2022-29404 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -n "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then
  # Stop Apache
  echo "Stopping Apache..."
  service httpd stop

  # Apply the patch
  echo "Applying patch..."
  patch -p1 < CVE-2022-29404.patch

  # Restart Apache
  echo "Restarting Apache..."
  service httpd start

  # Check if the patch was successful
  if [ -n "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then
    echo "Patch applied successfully!"
  else
    echo "Patch failed to apply!"
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will stop Apache, apply the patch, and then restart Apache. If Apache is not running, the script will print a message stating that Apache is not running.
