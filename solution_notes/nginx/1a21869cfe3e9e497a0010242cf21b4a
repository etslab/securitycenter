The OWASP Top 10 2021 category for this issue is **A1: Broken Authentication**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass or undermine authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, multi-factor authentication, and session tokens.

By failing to renew your SSL/TLS certificate, you are essentially leaving your website open to attack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to your website and steal sensitive data, such as user credentials, credit card numbers, and other personal information.

It is important to renew your SSL/TLS certificates before they expire. This will help to protect your website and its visitors from attack.
