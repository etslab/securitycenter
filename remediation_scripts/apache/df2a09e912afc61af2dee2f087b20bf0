####patch script to remediate  CVE-2021-33193 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2021-33193 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /var/run/httpd.pid ]; then

  # Get the current version of Apache
  version=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If the current version is vulnerable, upgrade Apache
  if [[ $version -lt "2.4.49" ]]; then

    echo "Upgrading Apache to 2.4.49..."
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y apache2

  # Otherwise, the server is already patched
  else

    echo "Apache is already patched against CVE-2021-33193."

  fi

# If Apache is not running, do nothing
else

  echo "Apache is not running. No action required."

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current version of Apache. If the current version is vulnerable, the script will upgrade Apache to 2.4.49. Otherwise, the script will print a message stating that the server is already patched. If Apache is not running, the script will do nothing.

Please note that this is just an example script. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment.
