**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The Policy AllowInsecureGuestAuth registry key setting in the LanmanWorkstation subkey allows users to access shared network resources on the server using insecure guest authentication methods. This can allow attackers to access sensitive data without proper authorization.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy AllowInsecureGuestAuth registry key to 0:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\LanmanWorkstation
```
3. Create or modify the Policy AllowInsecureGuestAuth DWORD value.
4. Set the value to 0.
5. Close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Mitigation Steps:**

* Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.
* Restrict access to shared network resources to only authorized users.
* Use IP address-based access control lists (ACLs) to limit access to shared resources from specific IP addresses or networks.
* Disable the guest account on the server.
