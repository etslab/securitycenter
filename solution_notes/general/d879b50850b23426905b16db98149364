**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure (A05)

**Issue Description:**

The Policy LockoutBadCount registry key determines the number of failed login attempts before the account is locked out. A high value for this key can allow attackers to repeatedly attempt unauthorized access to the system, potentially leading to a successful brute-force attack.

**Solution:**

1. **Configure a lower lockout threshold:** Set the Policy LockoutBadCount registry key to a lower value, such as 3 or 5. This will limit the number of failed login attempts before an account is locked out.
2. **Enable account lockout:** Ensure that account lockout is enabled in the system's security settings. When enabled, accounts will be locked out after a specified number of failed login attempts.
3. **Use strong passwords:** Implement a strong password policy that requires users to create complex passwords that are difficult to guess or brute-force.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA to add an extra layer of security to login processes. 2FA requires users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to their mobile phone, in addition to their password.
5. **Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS):** Monitor the system for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts, and take action to block these attempts.
6. **Review server logs:** Regularly review server logs to identify any unusual activity or failed login attempts. This can help you identify potential brute force attacks early on.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* Enforce password expiration policies to prevent attackers from using compromised credentials for extended periods.
* Block IP addresses from which repeated failed login attempts originate.
* Use captcha or other mechanisms to prevent automated brute-force attacks.
* Educate users about the importance of creating strong passwords and not sharing them with others.
