**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Security Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Navigate to the Registry:**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient
```

**2. Check the Policy EnableNetbios Value:**

* Look for the DWORD value named "EnableNetbios".
* By default, it should be set to "0". If it is set to "1", NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled.

**3. Disable NetBIOS:**

* If NetBIOS is enabled (EnableNetbios = 1), set it to "0" to disable it.
* Right-click on the "EnableNetbios" value and select "Modify".
* Change the "Value data" to "0".
* Click "OK" to save the changes.

**4. Restart the DNS Client Service:**

* Open the Services window (services.msc).
* Locate the "DNS Client" service.
* Right-click on the service and select "Restart".

**Additional Notes:**

* NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) is a protocol used for name resolution in older Windows versions and some network devices.
* Disabling NetBIOS can help prevent certain types of network attacks, such as NetBIOS name server (NBTNS) poisoning.
* It is recommended to disable NetBIOS if it is not required for your network.
