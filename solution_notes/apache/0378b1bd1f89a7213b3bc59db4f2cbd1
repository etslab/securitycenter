**Solution:**

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the `ba_forgotten.php` file in your code editor.
2. Locate the following code:

```php
$email = $_POST['email'];
$user = getUser($email);
if ($user) {
    // ...
}
```

3. Modify the code to check if the current user has permission to access the user's information:

```php
$email = $_POST['email'];
$currentUser = getCurrentUser();
if (!currentUser->canAccessUser($user)) {
    // Handle unauthorized access attempt
}
$user = getUser($email);
if ($user) {
    // ...
}
```

This solution restricts access to the user's information to only authorized users, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and potentially sensitive data exposure.
