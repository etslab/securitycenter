**Severity:** High

**Impact:** The lack of adequate logging can hinder forensic investigations and compromise compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile\Logging
```

2. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named "LogFileSize" if it does not exist.

3. Set the "LogFileSize" value to the maximum allowable file size (in megabytes) for the firewall log files. For example, to set the maximum file size to 100 MB, set the value to "100".

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not Applicable

This issue does not directly map to any OWASP Top 10 2021 categories as it pertains to system logging configuration rather than application security. However, it is related to the principle of "Security Logging and Monitoring" in the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls.
