###How to fix the Certificates issue of TLS1, offered (deprecated) in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the Certificates issue of TLS1, offered (deprecated) in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the nginx configuration file.
2. Locate the ssl_protocols directive.
3. Change the value of the directive to only allow TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. For example, the following code would only allow TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3:

```
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
```

4. Save the configuration file.
5. Restart the nginx service.

This will prevent nginx from offering TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, which are both deprecated and no longer considered secure.

The OWASP Top 10 2021 category for this issue is **A1: Broken Authentication**. This category covers vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data by bypassing or subverting authentication mechanisms.

In this case, the attacker could exploit the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the web server by bypassing the authentication mechanism.

To mitigate this risk, you should ensure that your nginx web server is configured to only use TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. You should also ensure that you have a strong authentication mechanism in place, such as multi-factor authentication.

Here are some additional tips for securing your nginx web server:

* Keep your nginx software up to date.
* Use a strong password for the nginx admin account.
* Enable HTTPS and configure it correctly.
* Use a firewall to restrict access to the nginx web server.
* Monitor your nginx web server for signs of attack.
