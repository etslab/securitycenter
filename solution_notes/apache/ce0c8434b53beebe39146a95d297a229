**Description:**
The `DisablePasswordChange` policy in the registry controls whether domain users can change their passwords. If this policy is set to 1, users cannot change their passwords, which can have several negative consequences:

- **Reduced Security:** Users who cannot change their passwords are more vulnerable to brute-force attacks and password theft.
- **Inconvenience:** Users may be locked out of their accounts if they forget their passwords or their passwords expire.
- **Compliance Issues:** Organizations that are subject to regulatory requirements may be required to allow users to change their passwords.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
```

2. Locate the `DisablePasswordChange` value.

3. Double-click the `DisablePasswordChange` value and set the value data to 0.

4. Click OK to save the changes.

5. Restart the server.

**Additional Notes:**

- If the `DisablePasswordChange` value does not exist, you can create it by right-clicking in the right pane and selecting **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value**. Name the new value `DisablePasswordChange` and set the value data to 0.
- Organizations should implement a password policy that meets their specific security requirements and complies with any applicable regulations.
