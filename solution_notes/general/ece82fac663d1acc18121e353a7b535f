**Solution:**

1. **Enable Policy Network Policy Server (NPPS) in Registry Logon/Logoff:**

   - Open the Group Policy Management Editor (gpedit.msc).
   - Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options.
   - Double-click on "Network security: Restrict NTLM: Audit RPC clients" and set it to "Enabled".
   - Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.

2. **Enforce Strong Passwords:**

   - Ensure that all users have strong passwords that meet the following complexity requirements:
     - Minimum length of 12 characters
     - Contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character

3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

   - Enable MFA for user access to sensitive resources. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a one-time password (OTP).

4. **Disable Legacy Authentication Protocols:**

   - Disable legacy authentication protocols, such as NTLM and LM, which are vulnerable to attacks.

5. **Monitor and Audit Logs:**

   - Regularly monitor and audit security logs for suspicious activities. This will help you detect any unauthorized access attempts or policy violations.
