###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2019-0196
The CVE-2019-0196 vulnerability is a use-after-free vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. It can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 request to the server, which can cause the server to crash or execute arbitrary code.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache HTTP Server to a version that is patched for the vulnerability. You can find a list of patched versions on the Apache HTTP Server website.

The CVE-2019-0196 vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of Injection. Injection flaws occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an application. This can happen when data is entered into forms, passed in URLs, or embedded in files. Injection flaws can be used to execute arbitrary code on the server, steal sensitive data, or cause other malicious effects.

To prevent injection attacks, you should always validate and sanitize all input data before it is used by your application. You should also use prepared statements or parameterized queries when accessing databases.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from common injection attacks.
* Keep your application software up to date with the latest security patches.
* Train your developers on how to prevent injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help protect your web application from injection attacks.
