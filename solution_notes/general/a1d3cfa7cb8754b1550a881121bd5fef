1. Download the latest Apache HTTP Server version from https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi.
2. Stop the Apache HTTP Server service.
3. Unzip the downloaded Apache HTTP Server package into the appropriate directory.
4. Copy the new files over the existing Apache HTTP Server files.
5. Start the Apache HTTP Server service.

**Additional Mitigation:**

In addition to applying the patch, it is recommended to take the following steps to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:

* **Update all software:** Ensure that all installed software is up-to-date, including Apache HTTP Server and the operating system.
* **Use a web application firewall:** A web application firewall (WAF) can help block malicious requests and protect the web server from attacks.
* **Restrict access to sensitive files:** Limit access to sensitive files and directories to only authorized users.
* **Monitor the server for suspicious activity:** Regularly monitor the server logs for any suspicious activity or attempted attacks.
