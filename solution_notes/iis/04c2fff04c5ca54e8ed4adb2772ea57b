**Detailed Solution:**

To fix CVE-2013-2566 in IIS Web Server, follow these steps:

1. **Apply Microsoft security update:** Install the latest security updates from Microsoft that address CVE-2013-2566. These updates will patch the flaw in the IIS WebDavDAVRequest.ExecuteRequest() function.

2. **Enable Request Filtering:** Configure Request Filtering in IIS to block malicious requests that exploit CVE-2013-2566. Specifically, enable the "Block webDAV requests" rule within the "Request Filtering" module.

3. **Disable WebDAV:** If you do not need WebDAV functionality, disable or remove the WebDAV module from IIS. This will prevent attackers from exploiting the vulnerability.

4. **Check for compromised systems:** Use a security scanner or other tools to scan your IIS web servers for signs of compromise. If a system has been compromised, remediate the infection and apply the security update.

5. **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF in front of your IIS web servers to filter out malicious requests and block attacks that exploit CVE-2013-2566.

6. **Follow secure coding practices:** Ensure that developers follow secure coding practices when developing web applications that use IIS. This includes validating input, using parameterized queries, and escaping special characters.

By implementing these measures, you can help protect your IIS web servers from attacks that exploit CVE-2013-2566.
