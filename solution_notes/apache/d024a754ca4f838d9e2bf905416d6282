**Severity:** High

**Issue Details:**

The `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission is required for an Android app to play media in the foreground. Apache HTTP Server is primarily a web server and does not need this permission. Granting this permission to Apache HTTP Server could allow malicious actors to exploit any vulnerabilities in Apache HTTP Server to start playing media in the foreground, which could potentially be used for malicious purposes such as tracking user location or capturing sensitive information.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, remove the `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission from the Apache HTTP Server manifest file. This can be done by editing the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and removing the following line:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
```

After making this change, rebuild and redeploy the Apache HTTP Server.
