**Issue:**

The "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" registry value is not set correctly, which allows local accounts to access resources that they shouldn't have access to.

**Solution:**

Set the "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" registry value to "1" in the following location:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```

**Detailed Instructions:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```

3. In the right pane, look for the "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" value.
4. If the value does not exist, right-click on the "System" key and select "New" -> "DWORD (32-bit) Value".
5. Enter "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" as the name of the new value.
6. Double-click on the new value and set it to "1".
7. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Explanation:**

The "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" registry value determines whether local accounts are allowed to access resources that they shouldn't have access to. When it is set to "1", local accounts are not allowed to access these resources. When it is set to "0", local accounts are allowed to access these resources.

Setting this value to "1" helps to improve the security of your system by preventing local accounts from accessing resources that they shouldn't have access to.
