**Detailed Solution:**

The issue is likely related to missing or incorrect permissions on the `apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libbuffer_pg.so` file. To fix it, follow these steps:

1. **Check File Permissions:**
   - Navigate to the `apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a` directory using a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `ls -l` command to view the file permissions for `libbuffer_pg.so`.
   - The permissions should be set to `-rw-r--r--` (read-write for owner, read-only for group/others).

2. **Set Correct Permissions:**
   - If the permissions are incorrect, use the `chmod` command to change them:
     - `chmod 644 libbuffer_pg.so`

3. **Restart Apache Server:**
   - Restart the Apache server to ensure that the changes take effect:
     - `service apache2 restart` (Ubuntu/Debian)
     - `systemctl restart httpd` (CentOS/Red Hat)

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the file is owned by the appropriate user (e.g., root or the user running the web server).
* Verify that the directory where the file is located has the correct permissions (e.g., `-rwxr-xr-x`).
* Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block unauthorized access attempts.
