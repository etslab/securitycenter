To fix the certificates issue of security headers in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if your nginx server is using a valid SSL certificate. You can do this by visiting your website in a browser and looking for the padlock icon in the address bar. If the icon is not present, or if it is displayed as "Not Secure," then your website is not using a valid SSL certificate.

4. Once your SSL certificate is installed, you will need to configure nginx to use it. The configuration process will vary depending on the version of nginx you are using.

Once you have completed these steps, the certificates issue of security headers in nginx web server should be fixed.
