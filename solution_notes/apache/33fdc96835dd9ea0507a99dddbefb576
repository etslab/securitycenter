**Detailed Solution:**

1. Log in to the server as an administrator.
2. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
3. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile
```

4. Right-click on the "PublicProfile" key and select "Permissions".
5. In the "Permissions" dialog box, make sure that the "Administrators" group has "Full Control" permission.
6. Clear the "Allow local policy merge" check box.
7. Click "OK" to save the changes.
8. Restart the server.

**Explanation:**

The "Allow local policy merge" setting allows local firewall policies to override group policy settings. This can be a security risk because it allows users to disable or weaken the firewall without the knowledge or consent of the network administrator. By disabling this setting, you can ensure that group policy settings are enforced on all computers in the domain.
