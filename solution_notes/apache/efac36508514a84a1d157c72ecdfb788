**Solution:**

**1. Disable Inheritance in Affected Registry Subkeys**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to the affected registry subkeys where policy handle manipulation is occurring.
* Right-click on the subkey and select "Permissions".
* Uncheck the "Allow inheritable permissions from parent to propagate to this object" option.

**2. Remove or Reset Unauthorized Permissions**

* In the Permissions window, review the permissions granted to users and groups.
* Remove or reset any unauthorized permissions that allow for policy handle manipulation.
* Ensure that only authorized individuals have access privileges to these subkeys.

**3. Enable Auditing and Monitoring**

* Enable auditing for the affected registry subkeys to track access events.
* Monitor the audit logs regularly for suspicious activity related to policy handle manipulation.

**4. Harden the Registry**

* Implement registry hardening measures such as:
    * Restricting access to registry keys to authorized users
    * Disabling unnecessary services and registry keys
    * Using registry protectors to prevent unauthorized modifications

**5. Keep Software and Operating Systems Updated**

* Apply the latest security updates and patches for the Apache server and the underlying operating system to address known vulnerabilities that may allow policy handle manipulation.

**6. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

* Consider using a WAF to block malicious requests that attempt to exploit policy handle manipulation vulnerabilities.
