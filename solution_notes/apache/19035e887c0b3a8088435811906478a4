**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the vulnerable dependency:** Verify that the libjbcrypto.so library is indeed vulnerable.
2. **Update the affected package:** Update all instances of the affected package to the latest version. The vulnerable version may have already been patched.
3. **Restrict access to the vulnerable file:** If updating the package is not feasible, you can restrict access to the libjbcrypto.so file using Apache mod_security or other web application firewall (WAF) rules.
4. **Monitor and remediate:** Monitor the affected system for any suspicious activity or exploitation attempts. Apply any necessary security patches and updates as they become available.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The presence of the vulnerable library alone does not necessarily indicate a security compromise. Exploitation requires additional factors, such as access to the vulnerable file and the ability to execute malicious code.
* It is important to note that this vulnerability affects only the x86 architecture. Systems running on other architectures are not vulnerable to this specific issue.
* Keeping your server and application software up to date is crucial for mitigating vulnerabilities and maintaining a secure environment.
