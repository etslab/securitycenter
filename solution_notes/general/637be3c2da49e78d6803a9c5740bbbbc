**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:**

The php:S2003 rule in SonarQube flags the use of `$_GET['password']` to retrieve the password without proper authentication. This is a vulnerability because an attacker could exploit this to access sensitive information by sending a crafted request to the `ba_forgotten.php` script.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, implement proper authentication before allowing access to sensitive information. For example, you could:

* Use a session or cookie to store the user's logged-in status.
* Require the user to enter their password to retrieve the forgotten password.
* Use a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open the `ba_forgotten.php` script in your editor.
2. Replace the following code:

```php
if (isset($_GET['password'])) {
    echo $_GET['password'];
}
```

3. With the following code:

```php
if (isset($_SESSION['logged_in']) && $_SESSION['logged_in'] === true) {
    echo $_GET['password'];
} else {
    header("Location: login.php");
}
```

4. Save the changes and upload the updated script to your server.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as input validation and encryption of sensitive data.
* Perform regular security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
* Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.
