####patch script to remediate  CVE-2022-31813 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2022-31813 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the Apache version
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is version 2.4.53 or earlier, then patch the vulnerability
  if [[ $apache_version -le 2.4.53 ]]; then

    # Download the patch from the Apache website
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/CVE-2022-31813.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2022-31813.patch

    # Restart Apache
