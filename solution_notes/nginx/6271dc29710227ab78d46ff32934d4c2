CVE-2019-0211 is a remote code execution vulnerability that affects nginx versions 1.17.0 to 1.17.9. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system by sending a specially crafted request to the nginx web server.

This vulnerability is a critical security issue and should be patched as soon as possible.

CVE-2019-0211 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of Injection. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an application. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the application server or steal sensitive data.

To mitigate the risk of injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize all input data before it is used by an application. This includes input from users, files, and other sources.

Here are some additional tips for mitigating the risk of injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block common attack vectors.
* Educate developers about injection attacks and how to prevent them.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks.
