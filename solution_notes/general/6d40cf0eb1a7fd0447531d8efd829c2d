**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The presence of sensitive files, such as the native library "libovpnutil.so," in the publicly accessible "apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a" directory on the Apache server indicates a potential file path traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access restricted files by manipulating the file path in the URL.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, implement the following steps:

1. **Restrict Directory Access:** Configure the Apache server to restrict access to the "apktool_out" directory using appropriate permissions or .htaccess rules.
2. **Remove Sensitive Files:** Move the sensitive library file ("libovpnutil.so") to a secure location outside the public web root.
3. **Implement Input Validation:** Implement input validation for any user-supplied parameters that could potentially be used to manipulate file paths.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic and block file path traversal attempts.
* Regularly review and update file permissions to ensure that sensitive files are not accessible to unauthorized users.
* Consider encrypting sensitive files or using secure storage solutions to prevent unauthorized access.
