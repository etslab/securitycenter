**Detailed Solution**:

**1. Enable X-Content-Type-Options header in IIS:**

* Open IIS Manager.
* Select the website or application for which you want to enable the header.
* Right-click and select "Edit Headers" from the context menu.
* In the "Response Headers" section, add a new header with the following settings:
    * Name: X-Content-Type-Options
    * Value: nosniff

**2. Check for Header Presence:**

* Use a web browser or tool like curl to access the website or application.
* Inspect the response headers for the "X-Content-Type-Options" header. It should be set to "nosniff".

**Additional Notes**:

* The "nosniff" value prevents browsers from guessing the content type of a response based on its file extension or other heuristics. This mitigates the risk of MIME type sniffing attacks, where an attacker tricks the browser into interpreting a malicious file as a different file type.
* It is recommended to enable this header on all websites or applications to enhance security.
