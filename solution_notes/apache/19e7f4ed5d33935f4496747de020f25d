**Issue:**
The DriverLoadPolicy key in the EarlyLaunch registry hive is not set to a sufficiently restrictive value. This allows untrusted drivers to be loaded into the kernel, which can lead to system compromise.

**Solution:**
1. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\EarlyLaunch
```
3. Right-click on the **DriverLoadPolicy** key and select **Modify**.
4. Set the Value data to one of the following values:
    - 0: Ignore driver load policy.
    - 1: Only allow signed drivers to be loaded.
    - 2: Only allow signed drivers from Microsoft to be loaded.
5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Recommendation:**
Set the DriverLoadPolicy key to a value of 2 to only allow signed drivers from Microsoft to be loaded. This will help to protect the system from untrusted drivers.
