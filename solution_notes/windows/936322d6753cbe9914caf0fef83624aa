**Solution:**

1. Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetBT\Parameters`.
3. Locate the `NodeType` DWORD value.
4. Set the value to `8` (Standalone Workstation or Server).
5. Restart the server.

**Impact:**

This setting controls the behavior of NetBT, a networking protocol used by Windows to resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses. By default, the `NodeType` value is set to `4` (Broadcast), which broadcasts all NetBIOS traffic to the subnet. This can be a security risk as it allows unauthorized hosts to eavesdrop on NetBIOS communications.

Setting the `NodeType` value to `8` restricts NetBIOS broadcasts to the local host only, reducing the risk of eavesdropping.
