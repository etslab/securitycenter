**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Open the Apache server configuration file:

    ```
    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    ```

2. Find the following line and enable the `AuditBaseObjects` directive:

    ```
    AuditBaseObjects On
    ```

3. Restart the Apache server:

    ```
    systemctl restart apache2
    ```

**Explanation:**

The `AuditBaseObjects` directive enables auditing of file and directory accesses. This is important for detecting unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories, such as those containing user credentials or financial data.

By default, this option is disabled. Enabling it increases the logging verbosity and can impact server performance. Therefore, it should be considered a high-severity issue and addressed promptly.
