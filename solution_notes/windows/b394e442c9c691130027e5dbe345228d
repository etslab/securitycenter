**Solution:**

1. Harden the Windows Registry permissions:

   - Restrict access to the Registry keys that control audit policy changes.
   - Only grant necessary permissions to trusted users or groups.

2. Enable Windows audit logging for Registry changes:

   - Configure the Security Event Log to log any changes to the Registry, including audit policy changes.
   - Review audit logs regularly for suspicious activity.

3. Use group policy to restrict registry access:

   - Create a group policy that restricts access to the Registry keys that control audit policy changes.
   - Link the group policy to the appropriate organizational units.

4. Implement antivirus and intrusion detection/prevention systems:

   - Install and maintain antivirus software to detect and block malicious activity that could manipulate the Registry.
   - Use intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor for suspicious activity that could indicate a Registry policy change.

5. Regularly review and update security configurations:

   - Periodically review Registry permissions and audit logging settings to ensure they are up-to-date and effective.
   - Update security configurations as needed to address new vulnerabilities.
