**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A7 - Injection

**Solution:**

1. **Disable non-essential privileges:** Remove any unnecessary privileges that are granted to the Apache server process. This can be done by modifying the user or group permissions in the Apache configuration file.
2. **Restrict registry access:** Use ACLs (Access Control Lists) to grant only the necessary permissions to the Apache server process to access the registry.
3. **Use a hardened Apache configuration:** Implement a secure Apache configuration by following best practices, such as disabling directory listing, using mod_security, and restricting access to sensitive files.
4. **Monitor and log registry activity:** Regularly monitor registry activity and configure logging to detect suspicious behavior.
5. **Implement input validation:** Ensure that user-supplied input is properly validated before being used in registry operations.
6. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded by the browser, mitigating the risk of injection attacks.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The specific impact and severity of this issue may vary depending on the specific context and configuration of the Apache server.
* It is essential to regularly review and update Apache configurations and security practices to address any potential vulnerabilities.
* Organizations should consider implementing a comprehensive security program that includes regular security assessments, vulnerability scanning, and incident response plans.
