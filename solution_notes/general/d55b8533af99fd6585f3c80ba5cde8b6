**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description:**

The Policy AllowLocalIPsecPolicyMerge registry key value is set to 1, allowing local group policy to override firewall settings configured via Windows Defender Security Center or other tools. This could allow unauthorized applications or users to bypass firewall protections and access sensitive data or systems.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile`
3. Locate the `Policy AllowLocalIPsecPolicyMerge` value.
4. Double-click on the value and change the data to `0`.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Set up a firewall that is designed to block malicious traffic and only allows authorized traffic.
* Regularly audit and review firewall logs to identify and block suspicious activity.
* Implement intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block attacks that attempt to exploit policy misconfigurations.
* Use a least-privilege approach when granting permissions to users and applications.
* Regularly update the operating system and software to patch security vulnerabilities.
