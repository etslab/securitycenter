####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 security headers has issue in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 security headers issue in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
    service apache2 status >/dev/null 2>&1
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Apache is running"
    else
        echo "Apache is not running"
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "Apache is not installed"
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the security headers are already enabled
if grep -q "ServerTokens Prod" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
    echo "Security headers are already enabled"
    exit 0
fi

# Enable the security headers
echo "ServerTokens Prod" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo "ServerSignature Off" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo "Header always set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo "Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
echo "Header always set X-XSS-Protection 1; mode=block" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart

# Check if the security headers are enabled
if grep -q "ServerTokens Prod" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
    echo "Security headers are enabled"
else
    echo "Security headers are not enabled"
    exit 1
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then check if the security headers are already enabled. If they are not, the script will enable them and restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the security headers are enabled again to make sure that the patch was successful.
