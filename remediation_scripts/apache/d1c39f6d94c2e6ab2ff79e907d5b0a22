####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-10082 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-10082 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Stop Apache
  sudo service httpd stop

  # Apply the patch
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2019-10082.patch

  # Restart Apache
  sudo service httpd start

else

  echo "Apache is not running."

fi
