   - Require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
   - Disable password reuse and enforce regular password changes.

3. **Implement two-factor authentication:**
   - Add an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, such as a mobile phone or security token.

4. **Monitor for suspicious activity:**
   - Use security monitoring tools to detect unusual login patterns or attempts to access unauthorized resources.

5. **Restrict access to the vulnerable port:**
   - Block access to port 88 by enabling a firewall rule that blocks incoming traffic from external IP addresses.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep your software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches.
* Ensure that all users have only the minimum necessary privileges required to perform their tasks.
* Regularly review and audit security logs for any suspicious activity.
* Educate users about the importance of strong passwords and security best practices.
