2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
```
3. Right-click on the fAllowFullControl value and select "Modify".
4. Change the value data from "1" (enabled) to "0" (disabled).
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Note:**

* This solution assumes that you have the necessary permissions to modify the registry.
* If you are not sure how to make these changes, please consult with a qualified IT professional.
