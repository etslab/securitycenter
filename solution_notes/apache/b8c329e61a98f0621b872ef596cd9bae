Injection flaws occur when unvalidated or unfiltered data is inserted into an input field or command that is then executed by a backend system. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including code execution, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection flaws:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Use input validation to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Sanitize all user input before it is used in a command or query.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect against injection attacks.
