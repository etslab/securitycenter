**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Solution:**

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters`.
3. In the right pane, look for the `EnableICMPRedirect` DWORD value.
4. Double-click on the `EnableICMPRedirect` value and change its data to `0`.
5. Click OK to save the changes.
6. Close the Registry Editor.
7. Restart the TCP/IP service.

**Reasoning:**

The `EnableICMPRedirect` registry setting controls whether ICMP redirects are enabled. ICMP redirects are a type of network attack that can be used to spoof IP addresses and redirect traffic to unauthorized hosts. By disabling ICMP redirects, you can mitigate the risk of these attacks.

This issue is rated as high severity because it could allow an attacker to gain control of your network traffic and launch other attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or denial-of-service attacks.
