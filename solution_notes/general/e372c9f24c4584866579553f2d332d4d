**Severity: Medium**

**OWASP Top 10 Category: A04: Insecure Design**

**Solution:**

1. Update the Apache server to the latest version.
2. Remove the vulnerable library (libapminsightb.so) from the server.
3. Review the server configuration to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed.

**Additional Notes:**

* The presence of the vulnerable library indicates that the server may be susceptible to remote code execution attacks.
* The attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of the server and execute arbitrary code.
* The severity of this issue is medium because the library is not essential for the operation of the server, but its presence could lead to a security breach.
