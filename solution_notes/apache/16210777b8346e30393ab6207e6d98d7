**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
```

2. Right-click in the right pane and select **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

3. Name the new value **NoWebServices** and set its value to **0**.

4. Restart the apache service.

**Explanation:**

The NoWebServices value controls whether users can access WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) resources on a remote server. When set to 1, this value disables WebDAV access, which can help protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data.

By default, the NoWebServices value is not set, which means that WebDAV access is enabled. Setting this value to 0 disables WebDAV access and addresses the audit issue.

Note that disabling WebDAV may affect applications that rely on WebDAV for functionality. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the impact before making this change.
