The App Dependencies issue of ruby-3.0.0.tar.gz:ruby-3.0.0.tar:DotZLib.csproj in apache web server belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of "A8: Insecure Deserialization". Insecure deserialization is a vulnerability that can occur when an application deserializes untrusted data without properly validating it. This can lead to an attacker being able to execute arbitrary code on the application's host system.

To mitigate the risk of insecure deserialization, applications should:

* Validate all input data before deserializing it.
* Use a deserialization library that supports safe deserialization.
* Use a sandbox to isolate deserialization from the rest of the application.

By following these steps, applications can help to protect themselves from the risk of insecure deserialization.
