**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A7 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Restrict Access to Registry Object Access:**

* Configure the registry to prevent unauthorized access to policy file shares.
* Use access control lists (ACLs) or permissions to limit access to specific users or groups.

**2. Enable Auditing and Logging:**

* Configure Apache to log all attempts to access registry object access.
* Enable detailed logging of registry changes to track any unauthorized modifications.

**3. Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**

* Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to detect and block malicious attempts to access registry object access.

**4. Harden the Server Configuration:**

* Disable unnecessary services and features on the Apache server.
* Remove unnecessary access points to the registry.
* Restrict access to sensitive server directories and files.

**5. Monitor and Review Logs Regularly:**

* Regularly review logs for suspicious activity related to registry object access.
* Establish a process to investigate and respond to any detected incidents promptly.

**6. Consider Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

* Implement a WAF to block malicious requests that may attempt to exploit the vulnerability.
