**Solution:**

1. **Verify the apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so file:**

   - Ensure that the file is not a malicious or rogue library.
   - Check if the file is part of a legitimate app or library and has not been tampered with.

2. **Review the Apache server configuration:**

   - Check the Apache configuration settings to ensure that the libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so library is not being loaded or used in any way.
   - Disable any modules or plugins that may be loading the library.

3. **Scan for vulnerabilities:**

   - Use a vulnerability scanner to check the Apache server for any known vulnerabilities related to the libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so library.
   - Apply any necessary security patches or updates to address any vulnerabilities.

4. **Restrict access to the library:**

   - If the library is required for a legitimate purpose, restrict access to it only to authorized users and processes.
   - Consider using access control lists (ACLs) to limit access to the directory where the library is located.

5. **Monitor the server:**

   - Implement monitoring to detect any suspicious activity or attempts to load the libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so library.
   - Regularly review logs and alerts for any unusual behavior.

**Additional Considerations:**

- If the libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so library is not necessary for the operation of the Apache server or any applications running on it, it is recommended to remove it completely.
- If the library is legitimate but not being used, it can be safely removed to reduce the potential attack surface.
