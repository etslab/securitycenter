####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2015-8325 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2015-8325 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -n "$(command -v httpd)" ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version is installed
VERSION=$(httpd -V | awk '{print $2}')
if [[ "$VERSION" =~ ^2\.4\.12 ]]; then
  echo "Apache $VERSION is vulnerable"

  # Apply the patch
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/linux/x86_64/httpd-2.4.12-patched.tar.gz
  tar -zxvf httpd-2.4.12-patched.tar.gz
  mv httpd-2.4.12-patched/httpd /usr/local/bin/

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl restart httpd

  echo "Patch applied successfully"
else
  echo "Apache $VERSION is not vulnerable"
fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and if the vulnerable version is installed. If the vulnerable version is installed, the patch script will download a patched version of Apache and replace the existing version. Finally, the patch script will restart Apache.

Please note that this is just an example patch script and may not work for all installations of Apache. It is always best to consult with a security professional before applying any patches to your system.
