**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libovpnexec.so is a native library that is bundled with an Android application. This library contains sensitive information, such as API keys and credentials. By extracting this library from the APK file using tools like apktool, an attacker could gain access to this sensitive information and compromise the application.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the sensitive information should be removed from the native library. This can be done by:

1. **Obfuscating the native library:** Using tools like ProGuard, the native library can be obfuscated to make it harder for attackers to extract the sensitive information.
2. **Encrypting the sensitive information:** The sensitive information can be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms before storing it in the native library.
3. **Storing the sensitive information in a separate file:** The sensitive information can be stored in a separate file that is not bundled with the APK file. This file should be protected with access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

**Mitigation:**

In the meantime, the following mitigations can be implemented:

1. Restrict access to the APK file by using access control mechanisms on the server.
2. Monitor the server for suspicious activity, such as attempts to extract the native library.
3. Educate users about the risks of downloading APK files from untrusted sources.
