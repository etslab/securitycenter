**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A08: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Solution:**

To fix this vulnerability, you need to disable the `android_webview_allow_file_from_url` directive in your Apache server configuration. This directive allows web pages loaded in an Android WebView to access files from the local file system, which can lead to XSS attacks.

Disable the directive by adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:

```
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
```

This will disable the directive and prevent web pages from accessing local files.

**Note:** Disabling this directive may break some legitimate functionality in your web application. Test your application thoroughly after making this change to ensure that it still works as expected.
