**Detailed Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient`
3. In the right pane, create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `EnableMulticast`.
4. Set the value data to `0`.
5. Restart the DNS Client service.

**Explanation:**

The EnableMulticast policy setting determines whether the DNS Client service will listen for multicast DNS (mDNS) queries. mDNS is a protocol that allows hosts to automatically discover each other on a local network without the need for a DNS server. While mDNS can be useful in some situations, it can also be a security risk, as it can be used to amplify DNS attacks and bypass firewalls. By disabling this setting, you can reduce the risk of these attacks.
