**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy MaximumPasswordAge registry key to a value within the recommended range of 60-90 days.

**Registry Path:**

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
```

**Key:**

```
Policy MaximumPasswordAge
```

**Recommended Value:**

```
60-90 days (in decimal format)
```

**Steps:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the registry path specified above.
3. Right-click on "Policy MaximumPasswordAge" and select "Modify".
4. In the "Value data" field, enter the desired number of days within the recommended range.
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.
6. Restart the server.

**Rationale:**

Setting a MaximumPasswordAge value within the recommended range helps prevent users from using weak or re-used passwords indefinitely. It enforces password rotation and reduces the risk of unauthorized access in the event of a password compromise.
