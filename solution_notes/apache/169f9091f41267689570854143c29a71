**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:**

Spectre is a security vulnerability that can allow an attacker to access sensitive information in the memory of a server. In the context of Apache, this could include passwords, session tokens, or other sensitive data.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can implement site isolation using the mod_rewrite module in Apache. Site isolation helps to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive information from other websites on the same server.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new .htaccess file in the root directory of your website.
2. Add the following code to the .htaccess file:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://example.com [NC]
RewriteRule ^.* - [F]
```

3. Replace "example.com" with the domain name of your website.

4. Save and close the .htaccess file.

**Additional Notes:**

* You may need to modify the RewriteCond rule to exclude specific domains or URLs.
* Site isolation can impact performance, so you may need to test and adjust the rules to optimize performance for your website.
* This solution only addresses the Spectre vulnerability as it relates to SSRF. Other mitigations may be necessary to address all aspects of the Spectre vulnerability.
