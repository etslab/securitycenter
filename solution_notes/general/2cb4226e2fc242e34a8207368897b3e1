**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A01: Injection

**Solution:**

**1. Apply Microsoft Security Update:**

* Install the Microsoft security update for CVE-2013-3587. This update patches the vulnerability and prevents attackers from exploiting it.

**2. Update ASP.NET Framework:**

* Ensure that ASP.NET Framework is updated to the latest version. This includes installing the latest security patches and updates.

**3. Use Safe Validation Methods:**

* Validate user input carefully before using it in any ASP.NET code. Use strongly typed languages, such as C#, and use data validation controls to validate input.

**4. Use Input Encoding:**

* Encode user input using HTML encoding or URL encoding before displaying it on the web page. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into the page.

**5. Use SQL Parameters:**

* When executing SQL queries, use SQL parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks. SQL parameters ensure that user input is properly escaped and sanitized before it is used in the query.

**6. Restrict Access to Sensitive Data:**

* Limit access to sensitive data, such as user names and passwords, to authorized users only. Use authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

**7. Use Anti-CSRF Tokens:**

* Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection by using anti-CSRF tokens. CSRF tokens prevent attackers from forging requests from the user's browser to the web application.

**8. Disable Unnecessary Features:**

* Disable any unnecessary features or services in IIS that could expose the server to attack. This includes disabling unused protocols and services.

**9. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to filter and block malicious traffic before it reaches the web server. A WAF can help detect and mitigate injection attacks.

**10. Regularly Review and Test:**

* Regularly review the web application for vulnerabilities and perform security testing to identify and fix any potential issues.
