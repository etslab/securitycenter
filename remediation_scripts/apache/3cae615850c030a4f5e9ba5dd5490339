####patch script to remediate  cert expirationStatus, expired in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate cert expirationStatus, expired in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current date and time
now=$(date +%s)

# Get the list of expired certificates
expired_certs=$(openssl x509 -noout -enddate -in /etc/ssl/certs/*.crt | awk '$2 < $now')

# For each expired certificate, remove it from the Apache configuration
for cert in $expired_certs; do
  echo "Removing expired certificate $cert"
  a2dissite $(echo $cert | sed 's/.*\///')
done

# Restart Apache
service httpd restart
```

This script will first get the current date and time. Then, it will get a list of all expired certificates on the system. For each expired certificate, it will remove it from the Apache configuration and restart Apache.

Here are some things to keep in mind when using this script:

* The script will only work if the Apache configuration is using the default SSLCipherSuite directive. If you have customized the SSLCipherSuite directive, you will need to modify the script accordingly.
* The script will not remove certificates that are in use by a running Apache process. If you need to remove a certificate that is in use, you will need to stop Apache before running the script.

I hope this helps!
