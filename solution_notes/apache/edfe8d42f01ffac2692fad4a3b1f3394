**Issue Details:**

The Test:DVWA-master/compose.yml file in the Apache server contains hard-coded secrets (passwords, API keys, etc.) that are visible to malicious actors and could be used to compromise the system.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the hard-coded secrets should be removed from the Test:DVWA-master/compose.yml file and stored securely in a secret management system, such as Vault or HashiCorp Consul.

**Steps to Implement the Solution:**

1. Create a secret management system.
2. Move the hard-coded secrets from the Test:DVWA-master/compose.yml file to the secret management system.
3. Update the Test:DVWA-master/compose.yml file to reference the secrets from the secret management system.
4. Test the changes to ensure that the application still functions properly.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use strong, unique passwords for all secrets.
* Rotate secrets regularly to reduce the risk of compromise.
* Monitor access to secrets to detect any suspicious activity.
* Train developers on the importance of secret management and how to securely store and use secrets.
