**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Verify Policy AuditDSAccess Configuration:**
   - Navigate to the Registry Event Audit settings in Apache configuration (httpd.conf).
   - Ensure that the "Policy AuditDSAccess" directive is set to "enabled".

2. **Restart Apache Server:**
   - Save the changes to the configuration file.
   - Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

3. **Test Audit Functionality:**
   - Create a new file or directory within the protected directory.
   - Check the operating system logs (e.g., /var/log/audit.log) to verify that the access attempt was logged.

**Additional Information:**

* The "Policy AuditDSAccess" directive enables auditing of write, delete, and rename operations on files and directories in the specified path.
* This audit trail provides evidence of unauthorized modifications or access attempts, helping to detect malicious activity or security breaches.
* Disabling this audit feature weakens the server's security by reducing visibility into potential threats.
