**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Authentication

**Detailed Solution:**

The issue is related to the use of the `ba_forgotten.php` file in bWAPP, which handles the password reset functionality. The file lacks proper validation for the email address entered by the user, allowing an attacker to bypass password reset restrictions.

To fix this issue, implement proper validation mechanisms for the email address, such as:

```php
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
  echo "Invalid email address";
  exit;
}
```

Additionally, consider using a rate limiter to prevent brute-force attacks against the password reset mechanism.

**Steps to Implement the Solution:**

1. Open the `ba_forgotten.php` file in your code editor.
2. Add the email address validation code after the line where the `email` variable is received.
3. Consider adding a rate limiter if necessary.

**Example Code:**

```php
if (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
  echo "Invalid email address";
  exit;
}

// Rest of the password reset code here...
```
