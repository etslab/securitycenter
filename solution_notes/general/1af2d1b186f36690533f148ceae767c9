**Solution**:

The stack exhaustion issue in the `encoding/gob` package is caused by excessive recursion during the decoding process. To fix this issue, you should set a maximum depth limit for the decoder. This can be done using the `gob.Decoder.SetMaxDepth` function:

```go
import "encoding/gob"

decoder := gob.NewDecoder(r)
decoder.SetMaxDepth(100) // Set a maximum depth limit of 100 levels
```

This will prevent the decoder from recursing indefinitely and causing a stack overflow.

**Additional Recommendations**:

* Consider using a different serialization format such as JSON or Protobuf, which are more efficient and less prone to stack exhaustion issues.
* Implement proper input validation to prevent malicious inputs from causing stack exhaustion.
* Monitor your application for any unusual behavior or errors that may indicate a stack exhaustion issue.
