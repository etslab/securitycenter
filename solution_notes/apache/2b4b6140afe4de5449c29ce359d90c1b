**Issue Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

The issue is caused by the improper validation of the `HTTP_REFERER` header. The following steps can be taken to fix the issue:

1. **Validate the `HTTP_REFERER` header:** Check if the `HTTP_REFERER` header is present and matches the expected value. If it does not match, deny access.
2. **Use a CSRF token:** Implement a CSRF token mechanism to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
3. **Restrict access to sensitive areas:** Limit access to sensitive areas of the application to authorized users only.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The `php:S4833` rule in SonarQube flags code that relies on the `HTTP_REFERER` header for access control. Attackers can manipulate the `HTTP_REFERER` header to bypass access restrictions and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This issue falls under the Broken Access Control category of the OWASP Top 10 2021, which focuses on vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

To fix the issue, it is important to properly validate the `HTTP_REFERER` header and implement additional security measures, such as CSRF tokens and proper authorization mechanisms.
