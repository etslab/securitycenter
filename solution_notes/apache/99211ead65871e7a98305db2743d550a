**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Disable Main Mode Authentication:** Navigate to the apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) and search for the following directive:

```
EnableIPsecMainMode
```

Change the value to "Off".

2. **Restart Apache:** Restart the Apache server using the appropriate command for your platform. For example, on Linux:

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**Additional Notes:**

* IPsec Main Mode authentication is insecure and should be disabled to prevent attackers from intercepting and decrypting data.
* This issue falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Sensitive Data Exposure, as it could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information passing through the web server.
* For enhanced security, consider using IPsec Tunnel Mode instead of Main Mode.
