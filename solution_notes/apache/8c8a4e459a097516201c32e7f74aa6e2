**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to restrict access to the registry account management APIs. This can be done by implementing the following steps:

1. **Enable IAM:** Ensure that Identity and Access Management (IAM) is enabled for your project.
2. **Create a service account for the registry:** Create a service account that will be used to manage the registry.
3. **Grant the service account access to the registry:** Grant the service account the necessary IAM roles to manage the registry, such as `roles/containerregistry.admin`.
4. **Use the service account to manage the registry:** Use the service account to make API calls to manage the registry.

**Note:** The specific IAM roles required to manage the registry will depend on the operations you need to perform. For more information on IAM roles, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles).

**Additional Mitigation:**

In addition to the solution above, you can also implement the following mitigation measures:

* **Use a firewall to restrict access to the registry:** This will prevent unauthorized users from accessing the registry even if they have the necessary IAM permissions.
* **Monitor your registry for suspicious activity:** This will help you to identify and respond to any attacks that may occur.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF attacks against your registry.
