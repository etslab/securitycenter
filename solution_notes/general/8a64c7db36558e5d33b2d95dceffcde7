**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A1: Injection

**Risk:** Injection attacks can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or system compromise.

**Solution:**

1. **Use Prepared Statements:** Prepared statements prevent SQL injection by separating the SQL query from the user input and ensuring that the input is properly sanitized. Replace `android_sql_raw_query` with `android_sql_exec` and use a prepared statement to bind query parameters:

```java
Database db = getWritableDatabase();
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
String[] args = new String[] { username };
Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(sql, args);
```

2. **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to ensure that user input does not contain malicious characters or SQL keywords:

```java
if (!username.matches("[a-zA-Z0-9_]+")) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid username");
}
```

3. **Limit Access to Sensitive Data:** Restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., user passwords) only to authorized users. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block injection attacks. Configure the WAF to inspect incoming requests for SQL injection payloads.

5. **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the dangers of SQL injection and best practices for preventing it. Ensure that they understand the importance of using prepared statements and input validation.
