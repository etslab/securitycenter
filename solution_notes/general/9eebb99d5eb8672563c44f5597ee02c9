**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to disable the "mod_negotiation" module in your Apache configuration. This module is responsible for handling content negotiation, which can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary data into an HTTP request.

Here are the steps to disable the "mod_negotiation" module:

1. Edit your Apache configuration file (typically /etc/apache2/httpd.conf).
2. Find the following line:

```
LoadModule negotiation_module modules/mod_negotiation.so
```

3. Comment out this line by adding a "#" at the beginning of the line:

```
# LoadModule negotiation_module modules/mod_negotiation.so
```

4. Save the Apache configuration file.
5. Restart the Apache server.

Once you have completed these steps, the "mod_negotiation" module will be disabled and your Apache server will be protected from CVE-2014-3566.
