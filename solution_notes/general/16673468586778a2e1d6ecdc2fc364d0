**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A7 - Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Review the permission declaration:**
   - The permission `android.permission.DUMP` is declared in the manifest with `android:exported="true"`. This means that any component can access this permission without any checks.

2. **Implement permission checks:**
   - Modify the code that uses the `DiagnosticsReceiver` to check whether the calling component has the `DUMP` permission. This can be done using the `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission()` method.
   - If the caller does not have the permission, the receiver should not respond to the broadcast.

3. **Limit the scope of the permission:**
   - If possible, consider using a more restrictive permission, such as `android.permission.DUMP_SERVICE`, which only allows the caller to dump the specified service.

**Example:**

```kotlin
override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
    if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(context, android.permission.DUMP) == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
        // Perform diagnostics operations
    } else {
        // Ignore the broadcast
    }
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

- Ensure that the receiver is only exported when necessary. If the receiver is used for internal communication within the app, it should be declared as `android:exported="false"`.
- Consider using a more secure mechanism for performing diagnostics, such as a custom broadcast intent with a specific permission.
