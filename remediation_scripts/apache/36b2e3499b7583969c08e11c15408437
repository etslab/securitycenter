####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-0220 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-0220 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/httpd ]; then

  # Get the current Apache version
  version=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')

  # Check if the current version is vulnerable
  if [[ $version -lt 2.4.39 ]]; then

    # Download the latest security patch
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz

    # Extract the patch
    tar -xvf httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz

    # Apply the patch
    cd httpd-2.4.39
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

    # Restart Apache
    systemctl restart httpd

  fi

fi
```

This script will download the latest security patch for Apache 2.4.39, extract it, and apply it. Once the patch is applied, you will need to restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when applying this patch:

* If you are using a custom Apache configuration, you will need to merge the changes from the patch into your configuration file.
* If you are using a third-party module, you may need to update the module to work with the latest version of Apache.
* It is always a good idea to back up your Apache configuration and files before applying any security patches.
