**Solution:**

The issue arises due to a vulnerability in the Parsedown PHP library, which is used to parse and render Markdown content. The library is vulnerable to a remote code execution attack when processing untrusted input.

To fix the issue, update the Parsedown library to version 1.7.3 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* Use input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent untrusted input from being processed.
* Limit user permissions and restrict access to sensitive data to prevent malicious users from exploiting the vulnerability.
* Monitor the application for suspicious activity and implement intrusion detection mechanisms.

**Steps to Update Parsedown:**

1. Download the latest version of Parsedown from the official website.
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to the desired location.
3. Replace the existing `Parsedown.php` file in your project with the updated version.
4. Clear your cache or restart the server to ensure the changes take effect.
