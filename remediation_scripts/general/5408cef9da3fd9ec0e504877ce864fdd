####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-10012 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2016-10012 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed
vulnerable_version=$(grep -oP "(?<=Server version: )[^ ]+" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf)
if [[ "$vulnerable_version" == "2.4.7" ]]; then
  echo "Apache 2.4.7 is vulnerable to CVE-2016-10012"
  echo "Applying patch..."
  patch -p1 < /path/to/CVE-2016-10012.patch
  echo "Patch applied"
else
  echo "Apache is not vulnerable"
fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed. If it is, the patch script will apply the patch to remediate the vulnerability.

Please note that this is just an example patch script and may need to be modified to work with your specific Apache installation.
