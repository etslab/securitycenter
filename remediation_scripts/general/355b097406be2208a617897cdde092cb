####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-10081 in Apache HTTP Server

#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(pgrep httpd) ]]; then
  # Stop Apache
  sudo service httpd stop

  # Apply the patch
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2019-10081.patch

  # Restart Apache
  sudo service httpd start
else
  # Apache is not running, so no need to patch
