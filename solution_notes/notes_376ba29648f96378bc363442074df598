**Severity: High**

AllowAdministratorLockout is a registry value that controls whether the operating system allows administrators to be locked out due to excessive failed login attempts. Setting this value to null effectively disables this security feature, allowing administrators to gain access even after repeated failed logins.

**Solution:**

1. Open Registry Editor (Start -> Run -> regedit).
2. Navigate to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
3. Right-click in the right pane and select New -> DWORD (32-bit) Value.
4. Name the new value `AllowAdministratorLockout`.
5. Double-click the new value and set the Value data to 1.
6. Click OK to save changes and close Registry Editor.
