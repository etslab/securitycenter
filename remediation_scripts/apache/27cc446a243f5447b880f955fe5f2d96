####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-6515 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2016-6515 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(pgrep httpd) ]]; then

  # Get the current version of Apache
  CURRENT_VERSION=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If the current version is less than 2.4.12, then patch Apache
  if [[ $CURRENT_VERSION -lt 2.4.12 ]]; then

    # Download the patch from the Apache website
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/CVE-2016-6515.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2016-6515.patch

    # Restart Apache
    apachectl restart

  fi

fi
```

This patch will add a length check to the password authentication function in Apache HTTP Server. This will prevent remote attackers from causing a denial of service by providing a long string as a password.

It is important to note that this patch is only necessary for versions of Apache HTTP Server that are less than 2.4.12. If you are running a newer version of Apache, then you are not affected by this vulnerability.
