**Detailed Solution:**

To fix the issue of Apache HTTP server rejecting certificate chains with distributed trust using GnuTLS, follow these steps:

1. **Enable the "remote-peer" TLS authentication method:**
   - Edit the Apache configuration file (e.g., `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`).
   - Add the following line:
     ```
     TLSOption RemotePeer
     ```

2. **Configure GnuTLS to trust the root certificate of the chain:**
   - Replace the default GnuTLS configuration file with one that includes the trusted root certificate.
   - Create a new GnuTLS configuration file (e.g., `/etc/gnutls/remote-peer.conf`).
   - Add the following lines to the file:
     ```
     priority = NORMAL
     remote-peer-type = TRUSTED_CA
     **certificate-file-ca1 = /path/to/root-certificate.crt**
     ```

   - Replace `/path/to/root-certificate.crt` with the path to the root certificate of the trusted certificate chain.

3. **Restart Apache HTTP Server:**
   - Stop Apache HTTP Server (e.g., `systemctl stop httpd`).
   - Start Apache HTTP Server with the updated configuration (e.g., `systemctl start httpd`).

4. **Verify the Configuration:**
   - Use a tool like `openssl s_client` to test the certificate chain validation:
     ```
     openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts -CAfile /path/to/root-certificate.crt
     ```

   - The output should show the trusted root certificate in the certificate chain.
