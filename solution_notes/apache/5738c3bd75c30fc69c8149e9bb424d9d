**Issue:**
Fallback SCSV (Secure Channel State Compression Vulnerability) is a cryptographic flaw in TLS/SSL protocols that allows an attacker to downgrade the security of a connection by forcing the use of weaker encryption algorithms. This can lead to sensitive data being compromised.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to disable SCSV in your Apache server configuration. This can be done by adding the following directive to your .htaccess file or httpd.conf file:

```
SSLCompression Off
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Ensure that your server is using the latest version of TLS/SSL (TLS 1.3 is recommended).
* Use strong encryption algorithms, such as AES-256 or ChaCha20.
* Regularly patch your server to fix any vulnerabilities.
* Implement other security measures, such as web application firewalls (WAFs) and content security policies (CSPs).
