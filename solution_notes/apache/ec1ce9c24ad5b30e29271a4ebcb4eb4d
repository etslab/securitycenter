**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Issue Details:**

The code in `Test:DVWA-master/dvwa/includes/DBMS/PGSQL.php` performs a query using user input without proper validation. This is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use parameterized queries, which prevent SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated as a literal value.

Here's an example of how to fix the code using parameterized queries:

```php
$query = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$query->bindParam(1, $username);
$query->execute();
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a library that supports parameterized queries, such as PDO.
* Sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.
* Ensure that the database user has the least possible privileges.
* Implement input validation to reject any suspicious input.
