**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Apache server is allowing unauthenticated access to a specific framework (Capacitor.framework) within an app bundle (App.app). This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality within the app.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to restrict access to the Capacitor.framework directory by adding the following directive to your Apache server configuration:

```
<Directory /path/to/Payload/App.app/Frameworks/Capacitor.framework>
    Require all denied
</Directory>
```

**Impact:**

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform the following actions:

* Gain access to sensitive app data
* Modify app functionality
* Install malicious code
* Impersonate authorized users

**Recommendation:**

* Implement the solution provided above to restrict access to the Capacitor.framework directory.
* Regularly review and update your server configuration to ensure that all sensitive directories are properly protected.
* Implement additional security measures, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms, to protect against unauthorized access.
