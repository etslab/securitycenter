###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of missing_directory.zip in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the App Dependencies issue of missing_directory.zip in nginx web server, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the nginx configuration file to make sure that the missing_directory.zip file is correctly referenced.
2. If the missing_directory.zip file is not referenced in the configuration file, add the following line to the `http{}` block:

```
location /missing_directory.zip {
  return 404;
}
```

3. If the missing_directory.zip file is referenced in the configuration file but does not exist, create the file or copy it to the correct location.
4. Restart the nginx web server.

Once you have completed these steps, the missing_directory.zip file will no longer be reported as an App Dependencies issue.

The App Dependencies issue of missing_directory.zip belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of **S05: Broken Access Control**. This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access resources or functionality that they should not be able to access.

In the case of the App Dependencies issue of missing_directory.zip, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive files or directories on the web server. For example, an attacker could try to access the missing_directory.zip file and see if it contains any sensitive information.

To mitigate the risk of this vulnerability, it is important to ensure that all App Dependencies are properly configured and that all sensitive files and directories are properly protected.

Here are some additional tips for mitigating the risk of App Dependencies vulnerabilities:

* Use a dependency management tool to track and manage your app's dependencies.
* Keep your dependencies up to date.
* Only include dependencies that are necessary for your app to function.
* Use a security scanner to scan your app for known vulnerabilities.
* Implement security best practices such as least privilege and role-based access control.
