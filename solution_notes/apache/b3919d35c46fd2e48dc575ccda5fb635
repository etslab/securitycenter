**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The presence of the apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libfile_lock_pg.so indicates that the Apache server is potentially vulnerable to path traversal attacks. This vulnerability can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive files on the server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should remove the apktool_out directory and its contents from the Apache server's accessible path. You can do this by:

1. Stop the Apache server.
2. Navigate to the Apache server's installation directory.
3. Delete the apktool_out directory.
4. Start the Apache server.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the Apache server is running with the least privileges necessary.
* Regularly review and update the Apache server configuration to ensure that no unnecessary directories are accessible.
* Use a security scanner to periodically check for vulnerabilities in the Apache server configuration.
