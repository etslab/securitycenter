**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Enable the Policy:**
   - Navigate to: `Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > System > Local Policies > Security Options`
   - Locate and double-click on "Use Default Domain Password Policy"
   - Enable the policy and click "OK"

2. **Configure the Registry Setting:**
   - Open Registry Editor (regedit)
   - Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\LAPS`
   - Create a new DWORD value named "PolicyADBackupDSRMPassword"
   - Set the value data to "0"

**Additional Notes:**

* The Policy ADBackupDSRMPassword registry setting controls whether the backup DSRM password is changed after a successful DSRM password change.
* Leaving this setting disabled means the backup DSRM password will not be reset, which could potentially allow an attacker to access the DSRM password if they gain access to the server or compromise the backup.
* Enabling this setting and configuring the registry value will ensure the backup DSRM password is reset after every successful DSRM password change, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access.
