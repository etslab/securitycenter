**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A07: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can implement the following steps:

1. **Disable CORS headers:** Remove the CORS headers from the Apache configuration file. This will prevent JavaScript files from being loaded from different domains.

2. **Implement Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Add a CSP header to the HTTP response. CSP will restrict the domains from which JavaScript files can be loaded.

3. **Use a reverse proxy:** If possible, use a reverse proxy server like NGINX to handle cross-domain requests. The reverse proxy can be configured to enforce CORS and CSP rules.

Here is an example of a CSP header:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
```

This CSP header allows JavaScript files to be loaded from the same domain (`'self'`) and from a trusted CDN (`https://trusted-cdn.com`).

**Additional Tips:**

* Regularly scan your web application for vulnerabilities.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block suspicious requests.
* Train your developers on secure coding practices.
