**Severity:** Low

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Authentication Failures

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Check Current PasswordHistorySize:**

* Open Registry Editor (regedit).
* Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Lsa`.
* Check the value of the `PasswordHistorySize` DWORD.

**2. Set PasswordHistorySize to 24:**

* If `PasswordHistorySize` is less than 24, double-click it and set the value to 24.
* Click OK to save the change.

**3. Restart Server:**

* Restart the Apache server for the changes to take effect.

**Explanation:**

PasswordHistorySize specifies the maximum number of previous passwords that are stored and checked when a user attempts to change their password. Setting this value to 24 forces users to create a new password that is different from their last 24 passwords. This mitigates the risk of password reuse, which can lead to account compromise.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is considered low severity because password reuse is a known risk, and setting `PasswordHistorySize` to a higher value is an effective and commonly implemented mitigation.
* While a higher `PasswordHistorySize` value can increase user inconvenience, 24 is a reasonable compromise between security and usability.
