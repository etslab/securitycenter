**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify and Remove Unnecessary Directory Listings:** Review the Apache configuration files to identify any directories that should not be publicly accessible. Remove any unnecessary directory listings to prevent attackers from accessing sensitive information.

2. **Configure Directory Permissions:** Set appropriate file and directory permissions to restrict access to authorized users only. Use the "chmod" command to change the permissions for specific files and directories.

3. **Enable Directory Service Access Control:** Configure Directory Service Access Control (DS Access) to authenticate and authorize users who access the directory service. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information in the directory.

4. **Limit Access to Sensitive Data:** Identify any sensitive information within the directory service and restrict access to authorized users only. Use access control lists (ACLs) or other mechanisms to grant specific users access to specific data.

5. **Use Virtual Hosts:** Configure virtual hosts to separate different applications and directories. This helps to isolate applications and prevent access to unauthorized directories.

6. **Enable HTTPS:** Implement HTTPS encryption to protect data transmitted over the network from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

7. **Monitor and Audit Logs:** Regularly review server logs to identify any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts. This will help to detect and respond to potential breaches promptly.
