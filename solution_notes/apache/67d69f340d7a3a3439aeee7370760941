**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Enable Strong Account Management:**
   - Restrict access to registry keys and values related to computer account management by implementing strong access control lists (ACLs).
   - Grant permissions only to authorized users and applications.

2. **Harden Registry Permissions:**
   - Set appropriate permissions for registry keys and values to prevent unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.
   - Consider using audit policies to monitor changes to these registry settings.

3. **Monitor Registry Activity:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track changes to registry keys and values related to computer account management.
   - Use security event monitoring (SEM) tools to detect any suspicious activity.

4. **Regularly Review and Update Policies:**
   - Regularly review and update registry permissions and access control policies to ensure they remain aligned with security best practices.
   - Remove unused or unnecessary registry keys and values.

5. **Use Least Privilege Principle:**
   - Grant only the minimum privileges necessary to perform specific tasks.
   - Avoid using administrative accounts for routine operations.

6. **Consider Virtualization:**
   - Isolate the registry on a separate virtual machine or container to minimize the potential for compromise.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Use a registry hardening tool to automatically identify and fix common security vulnerabilities in the registry.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for access to critical registry keys and values.
- Educate administrators on the importance of proper registry management and the risks associated with granting excessive permissions.
