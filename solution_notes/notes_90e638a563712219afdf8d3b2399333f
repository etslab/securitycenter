**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Logging & Monitoring (A8)

**Detailed Solution:**

This audit issue refers to the maximum size limit set for the Windows Firewall log file. If the log file exceeds this limit, it will stop logging events, which could result in missed security alerts and reduced visibility into firewall activity.

To resolve this issue:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).

2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging`

3. Locate the `LogFileSize` DWORD value.

4. Double-click the value and set the desired maximum log file size in bytes (e.g., 10485760 = 10 MB).

5. Click OK to save the changes.

6. Restart the Windows Firewall service.

**Recommendation:**

It is recommended to set the log file size to a value that is large enough to ensure that it does not fill up and stop logging events but not so large that it becomes difficult to manage. Monitor the log file size and adjust the limit as needed.
