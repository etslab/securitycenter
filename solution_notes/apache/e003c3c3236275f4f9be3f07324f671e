**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Restrict File Permissions:**
   - Configure the web server to restrict write access to sensitive directories to only necessary users or groups.
   - Use file permissions such as 755 or 644 to prevent unauthorized write access.

2. **Implement Input Validation:**
   - Validate all file uploads and user input to ensure that they do not contain malicious code or sensitive information.
   - Use filters, antivirus software, or other security measures to detect and remove potential threats.

3. **Use Least Privilege:**
   - Only grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
   - Avoid using generic or root accounts, and always use specific roles or permissions.

4. **Secure Server Configuration:**
   - Ensure that the web server is properly configured to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure.
   - Use firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect the server.

5. **Use Safe File Handling Techniques:**
   - Use secure file handling libraries or functions to safely read, write, and manipulate files.
   - Avoid using unsafe functions or direct file access that could expose sensitive data.

**Additional Tips:**

- Regularly review and update file permissions to ensure they are current and appropriate.
- Monitor server logs for suspicious activity related to file modifications.
- Educate users about the importance of secure file handling practices.
