**Solution:**

1. **On the Active Directory server:**
   - Navigate to `Group Policy Management` (gpmc.msc).
   - Right-click on the desired Group Policy Object (GPO) and select `Edit`.
   - Navigate to `Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Software Settings -> Software Policies -> Registry`.
   - Right-click on `Printers` and select `New -> Key`.
   - In the `Create Key` dialog, enter the following values:
     - **Key path:** Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers
     - **Value name:** RedirectionGuardPolicy
     - **Value type:** DWORD
     - **Value data:** 1 (Enabled)
   - Click `OK` to save the changes.

2. **On the apache server:**
   - In the Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf`), add the following directive:
     ```
     PrintEnv mod_access_compat
     ```

**Impact:**

The `RedirectionGuardPolicy` registry setting prevents a remote attacker from redirecting printer output to a different printer by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications that use the Windows printing system. By disabling this setting, an attacker could potentially redirect sensitive documents to unauthorized recipients.

**Additional Notes:**

- Apache releases prior to 2.4.53 are vulnerable to a print spooling redirection attack that can allow an attacker to redirect printer output to an arbitrary remote host. This issue is mitigated by the `mod_access_compat` directive.
- It's recommended to set the `RedirectionGuardPolicy` registry key to `0` (Disabled) on standalone computers that do not require this protection.
