**Which OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category does this issue belong to?**

The App Dependencies issue of merge-deep:3.0.2 of pkg:npm/merge-deep@3.0.2 in nginx web server belongs to the **A2: Broken Authentication** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. This category refers to vulnerabilities that occur when applications do not properly authenticate or authorize users.

The merge-deep package is a JavaScript library that is used to merge objects together. It is a popular package that is used by many different applications. However, the 3.0.2 version of the package contains a security vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to applications.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an application that is using the merge-deep package. The request will contain a malicious object that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. If the application does not properly validate the request, the attacker will be able to gain unauthorized access to the application.

To protect against this vulnerability, it is important to update the merge-deep package to the latest version and to restart the nginx web server. Additionally, it is important to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for all applications.

Here are some additional tips for protecting against OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 vulnerabilities:

* Keep your software up to date.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF).
* Implement strong password policies.
* Use secure coding practices.
* Perform regular security audits.
