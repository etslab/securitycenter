###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2022-31813
CVE-2022-31813 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server that allows an attacker to bypass IP-based authentication on the origin server or application. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Apache HTTP Server does not send the X-Forwarded-* headers to the origin server if the client's Connection header contains the hop-by-hop mechanism. This allows an attacker to spoof their IP address and bypass authentication.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.54 or later. If you cannot upgrade, you can disable the hop-by-hop mechanism by adding the following directive to your Apache configuration file:

```
RequestHeader unset Connection
```

This will prevent Apache HTTP Server from dropping the X-Forwarded-* headers.

This vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Authentication Failure. Authentication Failure is a category of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms. This can be done by exploiting weaknesses in the authentication process, such as weak passwords, poor password management, or lack of multi-factor authentication.

Here are some additional tips to help you protect your Apache HTTP Server from attack:

* Keep your Apache HTTP Server software up to date.
* Use strong passwords and change them regularly.
* Enable multi-factor authentication.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your server from attack.
* Monitor your Apache HTTP Server for signs of attack.
