####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the current version of Apache is vulnerable
if ! grep -q "CVE-2013-0169" /etc/apache2/CVE-2013-0169.txt; then
  echo "Apache is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169."
  exit 0
fi

# Apply the patch
echo "Applying patch..."
patch -p1 < CVE-2013-0169.patch
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Patch failed to apply."
  exit 1
fi

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache..."
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Failed to restart Apache."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch applied successfully."
```

This patch will add anti-CSRF tokens to all forms in Apache. This will help to protect your website from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

* You should always keep your Apache software up to date. This will help to ensure that you are protected from the latest security vulnerabilities.
* You should also configure your Apache web server to use strong passwords and other security measures. This will help to protect your website from other types of attacks.
