**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Impact:**

* Unauthorized access to sensitive user data or functionality, such as playing music without permission.
* Potential for malicious code execution by exploiting the exported activity.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the `android:exported` attribute to `false` in the AndroidManifest.xml file for the `MusicPlayerActivity` class. This will prevent the activity from being accessible directly from outside the application.

```xml
<activity
    android:name="io.awesome.gagtube.download.ui.player.MusicPlayerActivity"
    android:exported="false">
</activity>
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Review all activities and services in your application to ensure they are not exported unnecessarily.
* Use permission checks to further restrict access to the activity.
* Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
