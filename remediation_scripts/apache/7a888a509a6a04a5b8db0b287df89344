####patch script to remediate  Server Leaks Version Information via Server HTTP Response Header Field in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate the Server Leaks Version Information via Server HTTP Response Header Field vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(pgrep httpd) ]]; then

  # Get the current version of Apache
  CURRENT_VERSION=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # Create a new configuration file
  NEW_CONFIGFILE="/etc/apache2/conf.d/version-leak-fix.conf"
  echo "" > $NEW_CONFIGFILE
  echo "ServerTokens Prod" >> $NEW_CONFIGFILE

  # Reload Apache
  apachectl configtest
  apachectl graceful

  # Check if the new configuration file was loaded successfully
  if [[ $(grep "ServerTokens Prod" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) ]]; then
    echo "Version leak remediation successful!"
  else
    echo "Version leak remediation failed!"
  fi

else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the current version of Apache. Next, the script will create a new configuration file and add the following line to it:

```
ServerTokens Prod
```

This line will tell Apache to only return the "Prod" string in the Server HTTP Response Header Field. This will prevent attackers from determining the exact version of Apache that is running on the server.

Finally, the script will reload Apache. Once Apache has been reloaded, the script will check to see if the new configuration file was loaded successfully. If it was, the script will print the following message:

```
Version leak remediation successful!
```

If the new configuration file was not loaded successfully, the script will print the following message:

```
Version leak remediation failed!
```
