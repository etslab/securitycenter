**Severity:** High

**Description:** The php:S2010 rule flags code that uses PHP's `exec()` function, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution (RCE).

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** **B1: Broken Access Control**

**Solution:**

* **Replace `exec()` with a safer function.** Use a function that provides stronger sandboxing, such as `system()`, `passthru()`, or `shell_exec()`.
* **Sanitize user input.** Validate and filter any user-supplied data that is passed to the `exec()` function.
* **Restrict the commands that can be executed.** Use the `escapeshellarg()` function to escape special characters in user input.
* **Consider using a whitelisting approach.** Only allow a specific set of commands to be executed.
* **Disable PHP's `exec()` function.** If possible, disable the `exec()` function in your PHP configuration.

**In the specific case of bWAPP-Test:bWAPP/ba_captcha_bypass.php:**

The vulnerable code appears to be:

```php
$captcha_code = exec("identify -format %w,%h " . $captcha_image);
```

This code uses the `exec()` function to execute the `identify` command on the server. The `identify` command can be used to retrieve information about an image file, such as its width and height. However, the user-supplied input to the `identify` command is not sanitized, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

To fix this vulnerability, you should sanitize the user-supplied input to the `identify` command. For example, you could use the `escapeshellarg()` function to escape special characters in the input.

```php
$captcha_code = exec("identify -format %w,%h " . escapeshellarg($captcha_image));
```
