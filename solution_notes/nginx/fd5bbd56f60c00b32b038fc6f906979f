The App Dependencies issue of ruby-3.0.0.tar.gz:ruby-3.0.0.tar:load_fixture.ext.dll in nginx web server is a Broken Access Control issue. This means that an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to unauthorized files or resources on the web server.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Update the version of ruby-3.0.0.tar.gz:ruby-3.0.0.tar to the latest version. This will patch the vulnerability and make it more difficult for attackers to exploit.
2. Remove the load_fixture.ext.dll file from the web server. This will prevent attackers from accessing the file and exploiting the vulnerability.
3. Configure the web server to restrict access to the load_fixture.ext.dll file. This will make it more difficult for attackers to access the file, even if they are able to find it.

You can also try the following:

1. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web server from common attacks, including Broken Access Control attacks.
2. Implement security best practices, such as input validation and output encoding, to help protect your web server from attack.

This issue belongs to the **A5: Broken Access Control** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain access to unauthorized files or resources on a web server.

Here are some additional tips for preventing Broken Access Control vulnerabilities:

* Use least privilege to ensure that users and processes only have the permissions they need.
* Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
* Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication to protect user accounts.
* Keep software up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Regularly test your web applications for security vulnerabilities.
