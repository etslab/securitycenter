**Solution:**

1. Edit the Windows Registry by navigating to `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest`.

2. Locate the `UseLogonCredential` DWORD value.

3. Set the value of `UseLogonCredential` to `0` (Disable).

4. Restart the server to apply the changes.

**Explanation:**

The `UseLogonCredential` registry setting controls whether the web server uses the user's logon credentials to authenticate with the Windows Digest authentication protocol. When this setting is enabled (`1`), the server will use the user's logon credentials, which can be stolen by attackers to gain access to the server and its resources.

Disabling this setting (`0`) forces the server to use NTLM or Kerberos authentication instead, which are more secure. This prevents attackers from stealing logon credentials and using them to compromise the server.
