**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, ensure that your apache server is configured with a valid DNS CAA record. A CAA record specifies which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are authorized to issue certificates for a given domain.

To configure a CAA record:

1. Create a CAA record using the following syntax:
```
<domain>.  86400 IN CAA <flags> <tag> <value>
```

Where:

* `<domain>` is the domain name you want to protect.
* `<flags>` is a numerical value indicating the type of CAA record (0 for critical, 1 for non-critical).
* `<tag>` is the key value pair, such as "issue" or "iodef".
* `<value>` is the value of the key value pair, such as the CA's name.

2. For example, to create critical CAA record that authorizes the Let's Encrypt CA to issue certificates for your domain, use the following record:
```
example.com.  86400 IN CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

3. Add the CAA record to your domain's DNS zone. You can do this through your domain registrar's control panel.

Once the CAA record is configured, it will prevent unauthorized CAs from issuing certificates for your domain.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to note that CAA records are not supported by all DNS providers.
* If your DNS provider does not support CAA records, you can consider using a DNSSEC DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) profile to achieve similar functionality.
