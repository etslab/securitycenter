**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A01: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

Registry Object Access (ROA) is a DNSSEC mechanism that allows a parent zone to specify which DNSSEC-validating resolvers are authorized to issue delegations for its child zones. An improperly configured ROA can allow unauthorized entities to create malicious DNS records for the child zones, potentially compromising the integrity of the DNS.

**Policy Application Generated in ROA Issue:**

This issue occurs when a registry object is created and a policy is applied to the ROA. This can lead to a situation where the policy is not correctly enforced, allowing unauthorized entities to bypass the intended access controls.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Review the ROA Configuration:** Examine the ROA configuration to ensure that it is properly configured and only authorizes trusted entities to issue delegations for the child zones.
2. **Remove Unauthorized Policies:** Identify any policies that have been inadvertently applied to the ROA and remove them.
3. **Enforce Strict Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures to prevent unauthorized entities from modifying the ROA.
4. **Monitoring and Auditing:** Regularly monitor and audit the DNSSEC configuration to detect any unauthorized changes or vulnerabilities.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Use a specialized DNSSEC validation tool to ensure that the ROA is correctly configured.
* Consider implementing Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSec) to enhance the security of the DNS infrastructure.
* Keep the DNS software and related components up to date with the latest security patches.
