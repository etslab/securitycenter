**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Affected Registry Key:** Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
```

2. **Set Permissions:** Grant the "Deny" permission to the "Everyone" group for the following registry value:

```
Value Name: AuditBaseObjects
```

3. **Restart the Server:** Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the "Deny" permission overrides any other permissions that may be granted to specific users or groups.
* Regularly review the Registry settings to ensure that the "AuditBaseObjects" value is set appropriately.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS), to monitor and prevent unauthorized access to the Registry.
