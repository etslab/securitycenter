####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Subresource Integrity (SRI) not implemented and external scripts are loaded over HTTP or use protocol-relative URLs via src in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Subresource Integrity (SRI) not implemented and external scripts are loaded over HTTP or use protocol-relative URLs via src in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status >/dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Apache is running"
  else
    echo "Apache is not running"
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not installed"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if SRI is enabled
if grep -q "SRI" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "SRI is enabled"
else
  echo "SRI is not enabled"
  echo "Enabling SRI..."
  sed -i -e '/LoadModule mod_headers.c/a\
    SRIEngine On' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
  echo "SRI enabled"
fi

# Check if all external scripts are loaded over HTTPS
for script in /var/www/*/index.html; do
  if grep -q "http://" $script; then
    echo "Found external script loaded over HTTP in $script"
    echo "Replacing with HTTPS..."
    sed -i -e 's|http://|https://|' $script
  fi
done

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart

echo "Done"
```

This script will check if Apache is running, if SRI is enabled, and if all external scripts are loaded over HTTPS. If any of these conditions are not met, the script will take the necessary steps to remediate the vulnerability.
