####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable module is enabled
if grep -q "mod_include" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "The vulnerable module is enabled."

  # Patch the vulnerable module
  sed -i -e "s/AllowOverride None/AllowOverride All/g" /etc/apache2/mods-available/include.conf
  a2enmod include

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl restart apache2

  echo "The vulnerability has been remediated."
else
  echo "The vulnerable module is not enabled."
fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and if the vulnerable module is enabled. If the vulnerable module is enabled, the script will patch the module and restart Apache. If the vulnerable module is not enabled, the script will print a message stating that the vulnerability has not been remediated.

Please note that this is just a sample patch script and may need to be modified to work with your specific Apache configuration.
