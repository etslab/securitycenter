**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Disable the use of RFC2409Oakley Group 2.** This group uses 1024-bit primes, which are susceptible to the LOGJAM attack.
2. **Enable the use of more secure Diffie-Hellman groups.**
   - For Apache 2.4 and later, add the following directives to your Apache configuration:
     ```apache
     DHParametersGenerator /etc/ssl/dhparams.pem 4096
     DHParamFile /etc/ssl/dhparams.pem
     ```
     - For Apache 2.2, add the following directives to your Apache configuration:
       ```apache
       SSLdhparam /etc/ssl/dhparams.pem
       ```
3. **Restart Apache.**

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Monitor your logs for any suspicious activity related to the LOGJAM attack.
* Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic.
* Keep your Apache server software up to date with the latest security patches.
