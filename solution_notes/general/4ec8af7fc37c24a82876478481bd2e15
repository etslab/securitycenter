## ###How to fix the Certificates issue of BEAST, VULNERABLE -- but also supports higher protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 (likely mitigated) in Apache web server

1. **Upgrade to a newer version of Apache**: Apache 2.4.29 and later versions are not vulnerable to BEAST.
2. **Disable SSLv3 and TLSv1**: These protocols are vulnerable to BEAST and should be disabled. You can do this by setting the following directives in your Apache configuration file:

```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1
```
3. **Use strong ciphers**: BEAST can be mitigated by using strong ciphers. You can do this by setting the following directive in your Apache configuration file:

```
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4
```
