####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 X-XSS-Protection header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 X-XSS-Protection header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if ! pgrep httpd >/dev/null; then
  echo "Apache is not running"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the X-XSS-Protection header is already enabled
if grep -q "X-XSS-Protection" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "The X-XSS-Protection header is already enabled"
  exit 0
fi

# Enable the X-XSS-Protection header
echo "X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart

echo "The X-XSS-Protection header has been enabled"
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is not, the script will exit. If Apache is running, the script will check if the X-XSS-Protection header is already enabled. If it is, the script will exit. If the header is not enabled, the script will add the following line to the Apache configuration file:

```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

The script will then restart Apache. Once Apache has restarted, the X-XSS-Protection header will be enabled.

The X-XSS-Protection header is a HTTP response header that can be used to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The header can be set to one of three modes:

* **1; mode=block:** This mode instructs browsers to block all XSS attacks.
* **0:** This mode instructs browsers to allow all XSS attacks.
* **1; mode=detect:** This mode instructs browsers to attempt to detect and block XSS attacks.

The default value for the X-XSS-Protection header is 0. This means that browsers will allow all XSS attacks. By setting the X-XSS-Protection header to 1; mode=block, you can help to mitigate XSS attacks against your website.
