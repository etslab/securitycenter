**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2: Broken Authentication

**Solution:**

1. **Update Apache Server to the latest version:** This issue is often fixed in newer versions of Apache.
2. **Configure Apache to use a more secure directory:** By default, Apache stores temporary files in the `/tmp` directory. Move this directory to a more secure location that is not accessible to other users.
3. **Set appropriate file permissions:** Ensure that temporary files created by Apache have appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Disable unnecessary modules:** Disable any Apache modules that are not required for your application. This reduces the attack surface.
5. **Enable mod_security:** mod_security is a web application firewall that can help detect and block suspicious requests.
6. **Implement input validation:** Ensure that all user-provided input is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious code execution.
7. **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to block malicious requests before they reach your application.

**Note:** It's important to perform regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities like this one.
