**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (A9)

**Issue:** The Policy LogDroppedPackets registry key is not set to 1, which means that dropped packets are not being logged. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot firewall issues and identify potential attacks.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging
```
3. Create a new DWORD value named LogDroppedPackets.
4. Set the value of LogDroppedPackets to 1.
5. Close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Notes:**

* You can also use Group Policy to set the LogDroppedPackets registry key.
* The changes you make will take effect immediately.
* You should regularly review your firewall logs to identify any potential security issues.
