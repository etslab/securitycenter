**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A5: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Disable BEAST (Block Encryption At The Server Side) attack:** This attack exploits CBC mode padding oracle vulnerabilities. To disable it, disable SSLv3 and TLSv1.0 protocols, as BEAST only affects these protocols.

2. **Enable TLS 1.2 or higher:** TLS 1.2 and above provide stronger encryption algorithms and protection against BEAST attacks.

3. **Disable weak cipher suites:** Disable the following cipher suites that are vulnerable to BEAST attacks:

   - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
   - DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
   - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA
   - DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA

4. **Update Apache server:** Ensure that your Apache server is running the latest version, which includes security patches for BEAST vulnerabilities.

**Steps to configure:**

1. Edit the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf).

2. Add the following lines to the configuration:

   ```
   SSLProtocol TLSv1.2
   SSLDisableCipherSuite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA
   ```

3. Save the changes and restart the Apache server.
