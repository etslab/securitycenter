**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Configure Nginx to Disable HTTP Compression for Sensitive Data:**

```
server {
    ...
    gzip off;
    ...
}
```

2. **Set the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Header:**

```
server {
    ...
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;
    ...
}
```

3. **Use Certificate Transparency (CT) to Prevent Misissued Certificates:**

Configure your web server to use CT logs and include the CT header in responses:

```
server {
    ...
    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;
    add_header OCSP-Stapling header;
    ...
}
```

4. **Implement HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) to Restrict Certificate Authorities:**

```
server {
    ...
    add_header Public-Key-Pins "pin-sha256=\"HASH_VALUE\"";
    ...
}
```

**Explanation:**

BREACH is an attack technique that exploits weaknesses in HTTP compression algorithms to extract sensitive information. By disabling HTTP compression for sensitive data and implementing additional security measures such as HSTS, CT, and HPKP, you can mitigate the risk of BREACH attacks.
