## Severity: Critical

## OWASP Top 10 2021 Category: A07: Broken Access Control

## Solution:

### Step 1: Identify the Critical Permissions

Audit logs or security scans should provide information about the critical permissions identified. They could include access to sensitive data, modify user roles, or execute privileged operations.

### Step 2: Review Apache Configuration

Examine the Apache configuration files (e.g., httpd.conf) for any directives that grant critical permissions to unauthorized users or processes. Look for configurations that use wildcards or allow access from specific IP addresses or domains.

### Step 3: Restrict Access with Authorization

Implement proper authorization mechanisms to limit access to critical permissions only to authorized users. This can be done using a combination of methods:

* **User Authentication:** Verify the identity of users before granting access to sensitive resources.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles with specific permissions and assign them to users or groups.
* **Least Privilege Principle:** Only grant the minimum necessary permissions to perform a specific task or operation.

### Step 4: Harden Default Permissions

In addition to restricting access, it's important to harden default permissions in Apache:

* **Use Strong Default Permissions:** Set default file and directory permissions to be as restrictive as possible.
* **Disable Unnecessary Modules:** Remove any Apache modules that are not required for the server's functionality.
* **Update Software:** Regularly update Apache and other related packages to patch known vulnerabilities.

### Step 5: Monitor and Audit

Continuously monitor Apache logs for suspicious activity or attempts to access critical permissions. Implement an auditing system to record all changes to user permissions and access to sensitive resources.

### Step 6: Test and Verify

Once the changes are implemented, thoroughly test the new configuration to ensure that critical permissions are properly protected and that legitimate users are not affected.
