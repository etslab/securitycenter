**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Problem:**

The presence of `apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libjbcrypto.so` in the Apache server indicates that the server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to access sensitive files and directories that are normally protected by the server's access control mechanisms.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can take the following steps:

1. Remove the `apktool_out` directory from the Apache server's document root.
2. Update your Apache server configuration to properly restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
3. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

**Detailed Mitigation:**

1. **Remove the apktool_out directory:**

   - Edit the Apache server configuration file (usually named `httpd.conf`).
   - Locate the `DocumentRoot` directive and change the value to remove the `apktool_out` directory. For example:

     ```
     DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
     ```

2. **Update the Apache server configuration:**

   - Add the following directives to the Apache server configuration file:

     ```
     <Directory "/var/www/html">
     Options -ExecCGI -Includes -Indexes
     Require all denied
     </Directory>
     ```

   - These directives will restrict access to the `/var/www/html` directory and its subdirectories.

3. **Use a WAF:**

   - Install a WAF on the server.
   - Configure the WAF to block requests that attempt to access files outside of the allowed directories.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is specifically related to Apache servers. Other web servers may have different vulnerabilities that allow directory traversal attacks.
- It is important to keep your Apache server up to date with the latest security patches.
