**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\RPC
    ```
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `RpcUseNamedPipeProtocol` if it does not already exist.
4. Set the value of `RpcUseNamedPipeProtocol` to `0`.
5. Restart the computer.

**Explanation:**

The `RpcUseNamedPipeProtocol` registry value controls whether the RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service uses named pipes or RPC over HTTP for communication. Setting the value to `0` disables the use of named pipes, which may be required for certain security configurations.

By default, the `RpcUseNamedPipeProtocol` value is set to `1`, which allows the RPC service to use named pipes. However, named pipes have certain security vulnerabilities, such as the ability for attackers to gain access to RPC channels by creating a pipe with the same name as an existing one.

Disabling the use of named pipes can help mitigate these vulnerabilities by forcing the RPC service to use RPC over HTTP, which is a more secure protocol.
