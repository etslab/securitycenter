**Severity**: Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category**: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description**: The code in question uses a MySQL function `mysql_affected_rows()` which is deprecated and should not be used. This function does not provide any meaningful information and can be safely removed.

**Solution**: Replace the call to `mysql_affected_rows()` with a more appropriate function, such as `mysqli_affected_rows()`.

**Steps to fix the issue**:

1. Open the file `dvwa/includes/DBMS/MySQL.php` in a text editor.
2. Find the line that contains the call to `mysql_affected_rows()` and replace it with the following line:

```php
$affectedRows = mysqli_affected_rows($this->link);
```

3. Save the file and restart the Apache server.

**Additional notes**:

* The severity of this issue is medium because it does not directly expose sensitive data to attackers. However, it could potentially be used to infer information about the database structure or contents, which could lead to other vulnerabilities.
* This issue falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Sensitive Data Exposure because it could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.
