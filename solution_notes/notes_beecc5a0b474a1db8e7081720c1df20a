**Solution**:

1. **Enable Lockout Policy**: Navigate to **Registry Editor** (regedit) and go to the following location:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters
```

2. **Create ResetLockoutCount Value**: If the **ResetLockoutCount** value doesn't exist, right-click in the right pane, select **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value**, and name it **ResetLockoutCount**.

3. **Set Value**: Double-click the **ResetLockoutCount** value and set its **Value data** to **1**. This means that after one failed login attempt, the lockout counter will be reset to 0.

4. **Restart Apache**: Once the changes are saved, restart the Apache service to apply the new settings.

**Explanation**:

The **ResetLockoutCount** registry value controls the behavior of lockouts for invalid login attempts. By setting it to 1, you ensure that a single failed login does not result in a permanent lockout. This helps prevent denial-of-service attacks where attackers repeatedly attempt to log in to lock out legitimate users.

**Note**: The ResetLockoutCount value only applies to local logins. For remote logins via SSH or other services, additional configuration may be required.
