**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2 - Broken Authentication

**Assessment:**

The LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry key is responsible for controlling whether local accounts can be used to access resources on the server. If this policy is set to 0, local accounts can access any resource on the server without being authenticated. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the server and its resources.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry key to 1. This will prevent local accounts from being used to access resources on the server without being authenticated.

**Steps to set the registry key:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```

3. In the right pane, double-click the "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" registry key.
4. Set the value to 1.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that you have a strong password policy in place to prevent unauthorized access to local accounts.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication or IP address restrictions, to further protect your server.
