####patch script to remediate  cert notAfter, 2020-09-03 06 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate a expired certificate in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if the certificate is expired
if [[ $(openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in /etc/ssl/certs/apache.pem) < $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") ]]; then

  # Generate a new certificate
  openssl req -new -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache.pem

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl restart httpd

fi


This script will first check if the certificate is expired. If it is, the script will generate a new certificate and restart Apache.

Here are some additional notes:

* The path to the certificate and key files may vary depending on your system configuration.
* You may need to adjust the permissions on the certificate and key files after generating them.
* You may also need to update the configuration of your web application to use the new certificate.

I hope this helps!
