**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Detailed Solution:**

This issue is likely an indicator of a potential SSRF vulnerability. LibtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so is a library that is used by Apache servers to process encrypted HTTP requests. If an attacker can somehow trigger a request to this library, they may be able to read or modify arbitrary files on the server.

To fix this issue, you should follow these steps:

1. Update Apache to the latest version.
2. Remove the libtobEmbedPagEncrypt.so library from the server.
3. Configure Apache to restrict access to the Tomcat server.
4. Implement input validation and filtering to prevent malicious requests from being processed.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Review your server logs to identify any suspicious activity.
* Perform regular vulnerability scans to identify and patch any other potential vulnerabilities.
* Consider using a web application firewall to block malicious traffic.
