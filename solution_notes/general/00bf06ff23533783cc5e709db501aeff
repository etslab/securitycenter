**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue:**

Policy DefaultInboundAction in Registry Software->Policies->Microsoft->WindowsFirewall->PublicProfile is set to "Allow", allowing inbound traffic from any source to reach the web server. This setting weakens the firewall and increases the risk of unauthorized access to the web server.

**Solution:**

**1. Strengthen the Firewall Policy:**

- Set Policy DefaultInboundAction to "Block" to block all inbound traffic by default.
- Allow only authorized traffic by creating specific firewall rules for necessary ports and IP addresses.

**2. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

- Implement a WAF to filter and block malicious traffic at the application layer.
- Configure the WAF to enforce strict access control rules and protect against common web vulnerabilities.

**3. Enable Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS):**

- Deploy an IDS/IPS solution to detect and block suspicious activity, including unauthorized access attempts.

**4. Harden the Web Server:**

- Install security patches promptly.
- Configure the web server to use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Disable unnecessary features and services.

**5. Implement Network Segmentation:**

- Create separate network segments for different parts of the web server environment.
- Limit access between segments to only what is absolutely necessary.
