**Impact of the Issue:**

The missing audit policy for account logon in the registry can lead to attackers bypassing authentication and gaining unauthorized access to the system. By disabling or modifying the audit policy, attackers can hide their activities and avoid detection by security monitoring systems.

**Mitigation:**

Implementing the provided solution by setting the appropriate audit policy for account logon in the registry ensures that all logon events are recorded and monitored. This allows for prompt detection and investigation of suspicious activities and helps prevent unauthorized access to the system.
