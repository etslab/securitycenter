**Issue Details:**

The encoding/xml package in Go is vulnerable to stack exhaustion during XML unmarshalling due to recursive data structures. This can occur when an XML document contains a large number of nested elements or attributes, leading to excessive memory consumption and potential denial of service.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Set a maximum unmarshalling depth:**
   - Use the `Decoder.SetDecoderOptions` method to set a limit on the maximum depth of nested structures that the decoder will process.
   - For example: `decoder.DecoderOptions = xml.DecoderOptions{MaxDepth: 100}`

2. **Disable entity expansion:**
   - Set the `EntityExpansion` field of the `DecoderOptions` struct to `xml.DisableEntityExpansion` to prevent the decoder from expanding XML entities.
   - For example: `decoder.DecoderOptions = xml.DecoderOptions{MaxDepth: 100, EntityExpansion: xml.DisableEntityExpansion}`

**Additional Mitigation Steps:**

* Use a tool like `xmlsec` or `libxml2` to validate XML documents before unmarshalling them.
* Implement rate limiting on XML requests to prevent potential DoS attacks.
* Log and monitor XML unmarshalling operations to detect any suspicious or malicious behavior.

**Note:**

While setting a maximum unmarshalling depth is a simple solution, it may not be suitable for all applications. If you need to process deep-nested XML structures, consider implementing your own XML parser with appropriate protections against stack exhaustion.
