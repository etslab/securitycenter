**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Authentication

**Solution:**

1. **Enable the Policy RequireLogonToChangePassword setting in the registry:**

    On Windows Server 2012 or later, open Registry Editor (regedit.exe). Navigate to:
    
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PasswordRestrictions`

    Create a new DWORD value named "RequireLogonToChangePassword" (if it does not already exist) and set its value to 1.
    
2. **Restart the server:**

    To ensure the changes take effect, restart the server.

**Rationale:**

Enabling the Policy RequireLogonToChangePassword setting forces users to be logged on to the server before they can change their password. This prevents attackers from gaining unauthorized access to accounts and changing passwords without the user's knowledge.

This issue falls under the "Broken Authentication" category of the OWASP Top 10 2021 because it involves a weakness in authentication mechanisms that allows attackers to bypass normal authentication processes.
