###How to fix the Web Threats issue of CSP: style-src unsafe-inline in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the Web Threats issue of CSP: style-src unsafe-inline in nginx web server, you can do the following:

1. Remove the `unsafe-inline` keyword from the `style-src` directive in your nginx configuration file.
2. Move any inline styles to a separate CSS file.
3. Update your nginx configuration file to include the following lines:

```
add_header Content-Security-Policy "style-src 'self'";
```

This will prevent the browser from executing any inline styles, which can help to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

The CSP: style-src unsafe-inline issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of **A1: Injection**. Injection flaws, such as XSS, occur when untrusted data is sent to a web application without being properly sanitized. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application, which can then be executed by other users.

By following the steps above, you can help to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks and improve the security of your nginx web server.

Here are some additional tips for improving the security of your nginx web server:

* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force browsers to use only HTTPS connections to your site.
* Use a strong password for your nginx server.
* Keep your nginx software up to date.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your site from common attack vectors.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your nginx web server secure and protect your users from attack.
