####patch script to remediate  cert chain of trust, failed (self signed). in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate the "cert chain of trust, failed (self signed)" error in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep -f httpd) ]; then

  # Get the name of the virtual host that is using the self-signed certificate
  vhost=$(grep -oP "VirtualHost \K[^ ]+" /etc/apache2/sites-available/*.conf | grep -v "#" | sort -u)

  # Generate a new self-signed certificate for the virtual host
  openssl req -new -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt

  # Update the Apache configuration file to use the new certificate
  sed -i "s#SSLCertificateFile.*#SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt#g" /etc/apache2/sites-available/$vhost

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl restart apache2

else

  echo "Apache is not running"

fi


This script will first check to see if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the name of the virtual host that is using the self-signed certificate. The script will then generate a new self-signed certificate for the virtual host and update the Apache configuration file to use the new certificate. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

This script should resolve the "cert chain of trust, failed (self signed)" error in Apache HTTP Server.
