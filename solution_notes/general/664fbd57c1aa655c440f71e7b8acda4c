**Detailed Solution:**

To fix the CVE-2017-17428 vulnerability in Apache server, follow these steps:

1. **Update Apache to the latest version:** The vulnerability has been fixed in Apache versions 2.4.29 and 2.2.32. Upgrade your server to one of these versions or later.

2. **Disable mod_status if not needed:** mod_status is the module that provides information about the state of the server. If you don't need this information, it's best to disable it to reduce the attack surface.

3. **Configure mod_status to hide sensitive information:** If you need to use mod_status, make sure to configure it to hide sensitive information such as memory usage and process status. This can be done by editing the mod_status.conf file and setting the following directives:

```
ExtendedStatus Off
AllowXMHReload Off
```

4. **Enable mod_security:** mod_security is a web application firewall that can help protect your server from various attacks, including this vulnerability. Enable mod_security and configure it to provide protection against this specific vulnerability by adding the following rule to the modsecurity.conf file:

```
SecRule REQUEST_FILENAME "@contains:///|" "phase:1,log,auditlog,deny,status:403"
```

5. **Verify the fix:** After making the necessary changes, restart Apache and verify that the issue is resolved by running a vulnerability scanner or manually testing the server for the presence of the vulnerability.

**Note:** It's important to note that this vulnerability is exploitable remotely, so it's recommended to patch and verify the fix as soon as possible.
