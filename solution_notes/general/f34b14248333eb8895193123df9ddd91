**Severity**: High

**Category**: Server Misconfiguration (A6)

**Impact**: This issue could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the Apache server.

**Solution**:

1. Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
2. Locate the following line:

```
LoadModule authz_userdb_module modules/mod_authz_userdb.so
```

3. Add the following line beneath it:

```
AuthzUserDBDeniedLogon LogLevel error
```

4. Save and restart the Apache server.

5. Verify that the log file (/var/log/httpd/error_log) contains log entries for denied logons.

**Additional Considerations**:

* Consider using a more secure authentication method, such as LDAP or Kerberos, instead of relying on local user accounts.
* Ensure that logs are properly configured and monitored to detect any suspicious activity.
* Regularly review and update Apache configurations to address any security concerns.
