####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 Server Leaks Version Information via Server HTTP Response Header Field in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 Server Leaks Version Information via Server HTTP Response Header Field in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status > /dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Stop Apache
    service apache2 stop

    # Patch the Apache configuration file
    sed -i 's/ServerTokens Prod/ServerTokens Prod,noversion/g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    # Restart Apache
    service apache2 start
  else
    echo "Apache is not running."
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not installed."
fi
```

This patch script will stop Apache, patch the Apache configuration file to remove the version information from the Server HTTP Response Header Field, and then restart Apache.

To use this patch script, save it as a file with a .sh extension, and then run it with the following command:

```
bash patch_script.sh
```

This will remediate the vulnerability and protect your server from attack.

Here are some additional details about the vulnerability:

* CVE-2013-3587 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server that allows an attacker to obtain the version information of the Apache server by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
* CWE-310 is a common weakness enumeration that identifies the weakness of leaking sensitive information, such as the version of a software application, through an HTTP response header field.
* The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain information about the Apache server, which could be used to launch further attacks.
* The patch script removes the version information from the Server HTTP Response Header Field, which prevents attackers from obtaining this information.
