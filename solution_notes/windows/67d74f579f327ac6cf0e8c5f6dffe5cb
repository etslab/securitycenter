**Severity:** Critical

**Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Issue:**

The issue arises when the web server uses Registry Logon/Logoff to authenticate users without properly enforcing policy user/device claims. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system resources by attackers who can exploit the vulnerability.

**Solution:**

To mitigate this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Policy User/Device Claims:** Ensure that the web server is configured to enforce policy user/device claims. This typically involves modifying the registry settings for the web server. Refer to the vendor documentation for specific instructions.
2. **Validate Claims:** Implement a mechanism to validate the user/device claims presented by the client during authentication. This can be done through the use of certificates, tokens, or other means.
3. **Enforce Authorization:** After validating the claims, enforce appropriate authorization controls to restrict access to resources based on the user's role and device characteristics.
4. **Use Secure Communication:** Ensure that all communication between the client and the web server is encrypted, such as using HTTPS or TLS.

**Impact:**

This vulnerability can have severe consequences, including:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data
* Escalation of privileges
* Denial of service attacks
* Data breaches
