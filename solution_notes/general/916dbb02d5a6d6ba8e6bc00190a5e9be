Here are some additional tips to help prevent injection attacks:

* Always validate input before using it in an application.
* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Use escaping techniques to prevent XSS attacks.
* Use input validation libraries to help prevent injection attacks.
