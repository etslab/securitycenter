####patch script to remediate  CVE-2020-11993 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2020-11993 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  VERSION=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If the version is vulnerable, patch it
  if [[ "$VERSION" -lt "2.4.44" ]]; then

    # Download the patch
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/src/httpd-2.4.44.tar.gz

    # Extract the patch
    tar -xf httpd-2.4.44.tar.gz

    # Apply the patch
    cd httpd-2.4.44
    patch -p1 < CVE-2020-11993.patch

    # Recompile Apache
    make

    # Install the new version of Apache
    make install

  fi

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, it will then check the version of Apache. If the version is vulnerable, the script will download the latest patch, extract it, and apply it. The script will then recompile Apache and install the new version.

It is important to note that this is just a sample script. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment. For example, you may need to change the path to the Apache binary or the location where you download the patch. You should also test the script in a development environment before running it on a production server.
