**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description:**

The apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libapminsighta.so file may contain sensitive information, such as credentials or security keys, which could be exposed if the file is accessible from the webserver.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Remove the sensitive file:** Delete the apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libapminsighta.so file from the webserver's directory structure.
2. **Restrict access to sensitive directories:** Ensure that only authorized users can access the directory where sensitive files are stored.
3. **Monitor file access logs:** Regularly review file access logs to detect any unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Implement encryption:** Encrypt any sensitive data stored on the webserver to protect it from unauthorized access.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a security scanner to periodically scan the webserver for vulnerabilities.
* Implement a firewall to block unauthorized access to the webserver.
* Keep the webserver and its components up to date with the latest security patches.
