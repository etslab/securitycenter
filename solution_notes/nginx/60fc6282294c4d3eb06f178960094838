**Solution:**

* **Configure Character Set Encoding**: In the nginx configuration file, add the `charset` directive to specify the expected character encoding for requests and responses:

```nginx
charset utf-8;
```

* **Validate Input Encoding**: Use input validation mechanisms, such as encoding specific libraries or regular expressions, to ensure that incoming requests have the expected encoding.

* **Set Content-Type Header**: Specify the correct `Content-Type` header in the response with the appropriate character set, such as `text/html; charset=utf-8`.

* **Disable Multibyte Characters**: If possible, disable the use of multibyte characters in user input and responses. This can be done by setting `multibyte_support off;` in the nginx configuration file.

**Additional Measures:**

* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: A WAF can detect and block malicious payloads that attempt to exploit character encoding vulnerabilities.
* **Regularly Update Software**: Keep nginx and any related libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
* **Monitor Logs**: Monitor nginx logs for any suspicious activity or errors related to character encoding.
