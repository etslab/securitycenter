**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the affected registry keys:** Determine which registry keys are being changed without proper authorization. This can be done by reviewing the audit logs or using a tool like Regmon.
2. **Set appropriate permissions:** Restrict access to the affected registry keys by setting appropriate permissions for users and groups. Only authorized users should have modify permissions.
3. **Monitor registry changes:** Implement a monitoring system to detect unauthorized changes to critical registry keys. This can be done using tools like Sysmon or Regmon.
4. **Lock down default permissions:** Review and harden default permissions for registry keys to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Use GPOs to enforce settings:** Enforce registry change policies using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to ensure consistency across all systems.
6. **Disable remote registry editing:** Disable remote registry editing to prevent unauthorized access from outside the network.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep the registry clean and up-to-date by removing unnecessary keys and values.
* Regularly review and update registry permissions as needed.
* Use strong passwords and encryption to protect registry data.
* Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and patch potential security vulnerabilities.
