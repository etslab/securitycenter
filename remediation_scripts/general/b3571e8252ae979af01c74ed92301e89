####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-6210 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2016-6210 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version is installed
VERSION=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')
if [[ "$VERSION" =~ "2.4.7" ]]; then
  echo "Apache 2.4.7 is vulnerable to CVE-2016-6210."
  echo "Patching..."

  # Download the patch
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/CVE-2016-6210/CVE-2016-6210.patch

  # Apply the patch
  patch -p1 < CVE-2016-6210.patch

  # Restart Apache
  service apache2 restart

  echo "Patch applied successfully."
else
  echo "Apache 2.4.7 is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-6210."
fi
