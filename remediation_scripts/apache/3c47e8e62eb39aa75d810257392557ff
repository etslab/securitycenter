# Check if the Apache HTTP Server is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache HTTP Server is not installed"
  exit 1
fi

# Check the version of the Apache HTTP Server
VERSION=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')

# If the version is less than 2.4.6, then apply the patch
if [ "$VERSION" -lt "2.4.6" ]; then
  echo "Applying patch to Apache HTTP Server"
  patch -p1 < CVE-2013-0169.patch
fi

# Restart the Apache HTTP Server
service apache2 restart

# Check if the patch was successful
if ! apache2 -v | grep -q "CVE-2013-0169"; then
  echo "Patch was not successful"
  exit 1
fi

# Success!
echo "Patch applied successfully"
```
