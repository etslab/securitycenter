**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A07: Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Install security updates:** Ensure that the Windows web server is up to date with the latest security patches from Microsoft.
2. **Configure Service Principal Names (SPNs):** Register SPNs for the Kerberos service accounts used by the web server. This will restrict the use of service tickets to authorized accounts.
3. **Limit Kerberos Delegation:** Configure the web server to only allow Kerberos delegation to specific hosts or domains. This will prevent unauthorized access to the server.
4. **Enable Credential Guard:** This feature in Windows helps protect Kerberos tickets from unauthorized access.
5. **Audit Kerberos Events:** Enable auditing for Kerberos events to detect any suspicious activity.
6. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Require MFA for all users accessing the web server to add an additional layer of security.
7. **Disable Legacy Protocols:** Disable insecure authentication protocols like NTLM to force the use of Kerberos.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly review user permissions and revoke access for inactive accounts.
* Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and patch security vulnerabilities.
* Enforce strong password policies and consider using password managers.
