**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**
The Policy LogDroppedPackets value is not set to True in the Registry Software-Policies-Microsoft-WindowsFirewall-PrivateProfile-Logging, which means that dropped packets are not being logged. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot network connectivity issues and identify malicious activity.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging`
3. Create or modify the DWORD value named `LogDroppedPackets` and set it to 1.
4. Restart the computer.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting only applies to the Windows Firewall. Other firewall software may have different settings for logging dropped packets.
* Enabling this setting can increase the size of the firewall log file, so it is important to monitor the log size and periodically clear it out.
* You can also use a third-party tool such as Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, which can provide more detailed information about dropped packets.
