To fix the Certificates issue of TLS1 1, offered (deprecated) in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the nginx configuration file.
2. Locate the `ssl_protocols` directive.
3. Remove `TLSv1.1` and `TLSv1.0` from the list of protocols.
4. Save the file and restart nginx.

This will disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, which are deprecated and considered insecure. Only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 will be allowed.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of **Insufficient Transport Layer Security**. This category includes vulnerabilities that can be exploited to downgrade the security of the transport layer, such as by using weak ciphers or by allowing insecure protocols.

Here are some additional tips for securing your nginx web server:

* Use strong ciphers.
* Enable HSTS.
* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). This tells browsers to only connect to your site using HTTPS.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF can help to protect your site from common web attacks.
* Keep your software up to date. Make sure that you are using the latest version of nginx and any other software that you use on your web server.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your nginx web server secure.
