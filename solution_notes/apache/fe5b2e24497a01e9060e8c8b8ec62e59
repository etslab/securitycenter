**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insecure Deserialization

**Impact:**

* An attacker could exploit this issue to change the Wi-Fi state of the device, enabling them to disable or manipulate Wi-Fi connections.

**Solution:**

* Remove the android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE permission from the Apache server configuration to prevent it from changing the Wi-Fi state.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Review other permissions granted to the Apache server and ensure that only necessary permissions are enabled.
* Use a vulnerability scanner to identify and fix other potential vulnerabilities in the Apache server configuration.
* Implement security best practices, such as using secure coding techniques, input validation, and data encryption.
