## Severity: High

## OWASP Top 10 2021 Category: A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

## Solution:

**1. Edit the Registry:**

* Open the registry editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile\Logging`.
* Locate the `LogFileSize` DWORD value.
* Double-click the value and set the Decimal data value to `10240` (10 MB).
* Click OK to save the changes.

**2. Restart the Windows Firewall Service:**

* Open the Services window (services.msc).
* Find the "Windows Firewall" service.
* Right-click the service and select "Restart".

## Detailed Explanation:

The `Policy LogFileSize` registry value determines the maximum size of the Windows Firewall log file. If the log file exceeds this size, new log entries will not be recorded. This can result in lost security events and make it difficult to troubleshoot firewall issues.

OWASP Top 10 2021 Category A3: Sensitive Data Exposure applies because the Windows Firewall log file contains sensitive security information. If the log file is not properly configured, it could be vulnerable to unauthorized access or tampering, which could compromise the security of the system.

Setting the `Policy LogFileSize` to an appropriate value ensures that the log file is large enough to capture all necessary security events while also mitigating the risk of data exposure.
