**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2 - Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

The issue arises due to the presence of libEncryptorP.so in the publicly accessible "apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a" directory on the Apache server. This library contains potentially sensitive functions that should not be exposed externally.

To fix the issue, implement the following steps:

1. **Move the library to a secure location:** Remove libEncryptorP.so from the public "apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a" directory. Place it in a directory that is not accessible from the web, such as "/private/lib".
2. **Update file permissions:** Ensure that the new directory and library have appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Edit Apache configuration (if necessary):** If Apache is configured to serve files from the directory where libEncryptorP.so was originally located, you may need to edit its configuration to exclude that directory from being served.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider using a solution like OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) or Burp Suite to identify and address similar vulnerabilities in your web applications.
* Regularly review logs for any suspicious activity related to this issue.
* Implement security headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to restrict access to specific resources.
