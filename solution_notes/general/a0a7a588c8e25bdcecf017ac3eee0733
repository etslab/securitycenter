**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the root cause:** Determine the reason why the libEncryptorP.so library is exposed in the Apache server's public directory. This could be due to misconfiguration in the Apache configuration files or a vulnerability in the application.
2. **Remove the library:** Remove the libEncryptorP.so library from the public directory. This will prevent it from being accessed by external attackers.
3. **Secure the application:** If the exposure of the library was caused by a vulnerability in the application, apply appropriate security updates or patches to address the vulnerability.
4. **Configure Apache correctly:** Ensure that the Apache configuration files are properly configured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive directories and files.
5. **Monitor and review:** Regularly monitor and review the Apache server logs for any suspicious activity or attempted exploitation.

**Steps to Reproduce the Issue:**

1. Access the Apache server via its public IP address or domain name.
2. Navigate to the URL where the libEncryptorP.so library is exposed, typically /apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libEncryptorP.so.
3. Verify that the library is accessible and can be downloaded.

**Example Apache Configuration to Prevent Access:**

```
<Directory /apktool_out/lib>
    Deny from all
</Directory>
```
