**Fixing the Certificates Issue for Secure Renegotiation**

1. **Verify Certificates:** Ensure that the server and client certificates are valid and trusted. Check if the certificates are expired, revoked, or self-signed.
2. **Configure OpenSSL:** Add the following directives to the OpenSSL configuration file (usually `/etc/openssl.cnf`):
```
RenegotiatePriority = none
```
This will disable SSL/TLS renegotiation.
3. **Restart Apache:** Restart the Apache web server to apply the changes.
