**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A07 - Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**
The Policy DisableNotifications registry value in the Windows Firewall is set to 1, which disables Windows Firewall notifications. This could allow an attacker to modify the firewall settings without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Solution:**
1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile
    ```
3. Double-click on the DisableNotifications value and change the value data to 0.
4. Click OK and close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Information:**
This issue falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category A07 - Broken Access Control because it allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the firewall settings by bypassing the normal notification process. This could potentially lead to a data breach or other security incident.
