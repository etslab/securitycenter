* Use a dependency management tool to track the versions of all components used by your web application. This will make it easier to identify and update outdated or vulnerable components.
* Regularly scan your web application for vulnerabilities, including App Dependencies issues. This will help to identify any issues before they can be exploited by attackers.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web application from common attacks, including those that exploit App Dependencies vulnerabilities.
