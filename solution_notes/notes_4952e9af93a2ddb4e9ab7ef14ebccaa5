**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to implement anti-CSRF tokens in your application to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Generate a unique CSRF token:**
   - Create a random, unpredictable token that is unique for each user session.
   - Store this token in a server-side session storage (e.g., database, cache).

2. **Include the token in all sensitive requests:**
   - Embed the CSRF token as a hidden field in all forms and AJAX requests that can perform sensitive actions (e.g., modify user data, submit payments).

3. **Validate the token before processing the request:**
   - On the server-side, compare the CSRF token submitted with the request to the token stored in the session.
   - If the tokens match, proceed with the request. Otherwise, reject it as a potential CSRF attack.

4. **Set HTTP headers to prevent external requests:**
   - Add the following HTTP headers to your responses:
     - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
     - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
     - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<duration>; includeSubDomains`
     - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; ...`

5. **Consider using a CSRF library or framework:**
   - Use a library or framework that provides built-in CSRF protection (e.g., Spring Security for Java, Django's CSRF middleware for Python).

**Additional Notes:**

* Ensure that the CSRF token is properly generated and validated for all sensitive requests.
* Regularly rotate the CSRF token to prevent attackers from predicting it.
* Use strong HTTP headers and CSP to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to bypass CSRF protections.
