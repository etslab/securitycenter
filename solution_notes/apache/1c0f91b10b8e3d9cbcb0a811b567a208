**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control (A05)

**Issue Description:**

The "HardenedPaths" policy in the Windows Registry is not properly configured, allowing unauthorized access to network shares. This can lead to sensitive data exposure and data tampering.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkProvider\HardenedPaths
   ```
3. Create or modify the following DWORD value:
   ```
   Name: AllowInsecureGuestAuthOnServer
   Value: 0 (disabled)
   ```
   Setting this value to 0 disables insecure guest authentication on the server, preventing unauthorized access to network shares.
4. Restart the Server service.

**Additional Notes:**

* Ensure that the "DenyUsers" and "AllowUsers" values are properly configured in the "HardenedPaths" policy to restrict access to authorized users and groups.
* Consider using a security tool to scan for and remediate any other hardening issues in the Windows Registry.
