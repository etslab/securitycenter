**Solution:**

1. **Enable Restricted Registry Access:**
   - Modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
   - Create or modify the DWORD value `EnableLUA` and set it to `1`

2. **Configure Registry Permissions:**
   - Grant only necessary permissions to users and groups that require access to specific registry keys.
   - Use the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) to set permissions on specific keys.

3. **Disable VBScript and JavaScript Support:**
   - These scripting languages can be used to manipulate registry settings remotely.

4. **Implement Application Whitelisting:**
   - Only allow authorized applications to access the registry.

5. **Use a Registry Monitoring Tool:**
   - Monitor registry changes to detect unauthorized modifications.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Regularly patch the operating system and software:** This will address vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain registry access.
* **Educate users about registry security:** Make users aware of the importance of protecting registry settings.
* **Restrict administrative privileges:** Only grant administrative privileges to those who absolutely need them.
