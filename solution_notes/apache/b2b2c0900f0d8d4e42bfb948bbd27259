**Solution:**

1. **Review Apache Configuration:**
   - Check for any directives that grant excessive privileges or allow remote users to modify the registry.

2. **Restrict Privileged Access:**
   - Limit the number of users or services that can access the registry.
   - Use access control lists (ACLs) or other mechanisms to restrict specific registry keys.

3. **Disable Unnecessary Privileges:**
   - Remove any privileges that are not required for the proper operation of Apache.
   - This may include the "SeRegistryKey" privilege, which allows users to modify the registry.

4. **Use Trusted Repositories:**
   - When possible, use trusted sources for Apache packages and modules to minimize the risk of malicious code.
   - Ensure that the packages are signed by a trusted certificate authority.

5. **Monitor Registry Changes:**
   - Implement a mechanism to monitor registry changes and identify any suspicious activity.
   - Consider using tools like "AuditPol" or "RegMon" for this purpose.

6. **Update Apache Regularly:**
   - Keep Apache and its modules up to date with the latest security patches.
   - This will address any vulnerabilities that may allow attackers to exploit registry privileges.
