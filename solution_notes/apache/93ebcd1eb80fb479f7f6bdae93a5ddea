**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Policy RpcTcpPort registry key controls the TCP port used by the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service for printer sharing. If this port is not restricted, attackers can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the printer queue and potentially compromise the entire print server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy RpcTcpPort registry key to a specific, non-default port. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\RPC
   ```
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named "Policy RpcTcpPort".
4. Set the value data to the desired TCP port number. It is recommended to use a port number that is not commonly used by other services.

**Example:** To set the RPC port to 1355, you would enter "1355" as the value data.

**Restart the RPC service**

1. Open Command Prompt as administrator.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   net stop rpcss
   ```
3. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   net start rpcss
   ```

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the firewall is configured to block access to the RPC port from untrusted networks.
* Regularly review the print permissions and remove any unnecessary users or groups.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as network segmentation and intrusion detection systems.
