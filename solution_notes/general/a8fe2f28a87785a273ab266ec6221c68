**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:**

The Policy LsaCfgFlags registry key determines the behavior of the Local Security Authority (LSA) Credential Guard. If this key is not set or set to zero, Credential Guard will be disabled. This can allow an attacker to bypass security measures designed to protect user credentials.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you must set the Policy LsaCfgFlags registry key to a non-zero value. You can do this by running the following commands as an administrator:

```
reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard /v LsaCfgFlags /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

Once you have made this change, you must reboot your server for the changes to take effect.

**Additional Information:**

Credential Guard is a security feature that is designed to protect user credentials from being stolen by attackers. Credential Guard stores user credentials in a hardware-isolated vault that is separate from the operating system. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to access user credentials, even if they have gained access to the operating system.

By disabling Credential Guard, an attacker could potentially bypass security measures that are designed to protect user credentials. This could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, and other personal data.
