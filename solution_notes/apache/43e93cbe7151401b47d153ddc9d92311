**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** **A05: Broken Access Control**

**Description:**

The sonarqube rule php:S6600 flags a potential broken access control vulnerability in the bWAPP application. Unauthorized users could potentially gain access to the "/admin/index.php" page, which may contain sensitive information or functionality.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, ensure that proper access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict access to "/admin/index.php" only to authorized users. This can be achieved using session management, role-based access control, or other appropriate measures.

**Implementation:**

1. **Session Management:**
   - Implement session management to maintain a user's session and identify authorized users.
   - Create session variables and set them for authorized users upon successful login.
   - Use session variables to check if a user is authorized to access "/admin/index.php".

2. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Define user roles and assign appropriate access permissions.
   - Grant access to "/admin/index.php" only to users with the "Administrator" role or similar elevated privileges.
   - Check the user's role before granting access to the page.

3. **Other Methods:**
   - Use a firewall to restrict access to "/admin/index.php" from unauthorized IP addresses.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks aimed at accessing the page.
   - Use a captcha or other security measures to prevent automated script attacks.
