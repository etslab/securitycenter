**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Issue Description:**

This issue occurs when the net/http package in Go does not correctly handle the "100 Continue" response from a client. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by sending a large number of requests with a "100 Continue" header, forcing the server to hold onto the requests until the client sends a complete request. This can eventually exhaust the server's resources and cause it to become unresponsive.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, update the version of the net/http package to version 1.13 or later. This version includes a fix that prevents the server from holding onto requests with "100 Continue" headers indefinitely.

You can update the net/http package using the following command:

```
go get -u golang.org/x/net/http
```

**Additional Mitigation:**

In addition to updating the net/http package, you can also implement the following mitigation measures:

* Configure your web server to limit the number of requests that can be handled in parallel.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending a large number of requests in a short period of time.
* Monitor your web server for unusual traffic patterns that may indicate a DoS attack.
