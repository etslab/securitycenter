**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Open the Registry Editor (regedit):** Press Windows Key + R and type "regedit". Click OK.

2. **Navigate to the following registry key:**
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
```

3. **Locate the following value:**
```
UserDomain
```

4. **Check the value data:** It should be empty or should contain the domain name of the user account. If it contains a value other than the domain name or if it is missing, this indicates a potential issue.

5. **If the value is not empty or does not contain the domain name:**
   - Double-click on the "UserDomain" value and clear it.
   - Click OK to save the changes.

6. **Locate the following value:**
```
UserInit
```

7. **Check the value data:** It should point to the legitimate userinit.exe file (%systemroot%\system32\userinit.exe). If it points to a different file, this indicates a potential issue.

8. **If the value points to a different file:**
   - Double-click on the "UserInit" value and change it to "%systemroot%\system32\userinit.exe".
   - Click OK to save the changes.

9. **Close the Registry Editor.**

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the computer account is not a member of any unauthorized groups.
* Regularly review and audit Registry settings for suspicious changes.
* Implement security measures such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls to protect against unauthorized registry modifications.
