###How to fix the Web Threats issue of CSP: style-src unsafe-inline
The Web Threats issue of CSP: style-src unsafe-inline in Apache web server can be fixed by adding the following line to the Apache configuration file:

```
Header set Content-Security-Policy "style-src 'self';"
```

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). XSS is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a website. This malicious code can then be executed by the victim's browser, which can lead to a variety of attacks, such as stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

By adding the above line to the Apache configuration file, you can help to protect your website from XSS attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing XSS attacks:

* Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded by your website.
* Sanitize all user input before it is displayed on your website.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help block XSS attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your website from XSS attacks.
