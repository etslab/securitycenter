**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Cryptography

**Description:**
The server's SSL/TLS certificate has expired on 2020-09-03 12:00 AM. This means that the certificate is no longer valid and the server cannot establish a secure connection. Browsers will display a warning or error when trying to connect to the server.

**Solution:**
1. **Generate a new SSL/TLS certificate:** This can be done using a certificate authority or by generating a self-signed certificate.
2. **Install the new certificate on the server:** This will typically involve replacing the old certificate in the server's configuration file.
3. **Restart the server:** This is necessary to apply the changes and start using the new certificate.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to note that the cert notAfter date is critical for maintaining the security of your website. If the certificate expires, the server cannot establish a secure connection, which could allow attackers to intercept sensitive information.
* It is also important to note that this issue can be exploited by attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. This type of attack allows the attacker to intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server, which could allow them to steal sensitive information or inject malicious code.
* To mitigate this issue, it is important to regularly check the expiration date of your SSL/TLS certificate and renew it before it expires.
