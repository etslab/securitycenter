* Apache web server does not support extended attributes. Therefore, the presence of the xattrs.tar file can indicate that a malicious application is trying to exploit a vulnerability in Apache.
* The OWASP Top 10 Web is a list of the most common and critical web application security risks. It is published by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the security of web applications.

**Recommendations:**

* Keep your Apache web server up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web applications from common attacks.
* Review your web application code for security vulnerabilities.
* Use a secure coding framework to help you write secure code.
