**Assessment of Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution to Fix the Issue:**

1. **Configure the Firewall Settings:**
   - Open the registry editor (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to the following key:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile
     ```
   - Create a new DWORD value named "EnableFirewall" and set its value to 1.

2. **Restart the Firewall Service:**

   - Run the following command:
     ```
     net stop windowsfirewall
     net start windowsfirewall
     ```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Ensure that the firewall rules are configured properly to allow inbound and outbound traffic as necessary.
* Regularly review and update firewall settings to maintain security.
* Use a security scanner or penetration testing tool to identify any other potential vulnerabilities related to the firewall.

**Note:** The severity of this issue is rated as "high" because it affects access control and could potentially allow malicious actors to access the server or its resources. It falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category "Broken Access Control" because it involves the improper configuration of access permissions for the firewall, leading to a vulnerability.
