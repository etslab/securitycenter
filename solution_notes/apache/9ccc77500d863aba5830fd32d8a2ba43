**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:**

The Policy RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures in Registry SOFTWARE->Policies->Microsoft->Windows->DeviceGuard is not set, allowing applications to bypass security protections provided by Device Guard. Device Guard is a security feature that helps protect devices from malicious software by enforcing code integrity and isolating potentially malicious code.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures to 1 in the Registry:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard.
3. Create a new DWORD value named "RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures".
4. Set the value to 1.
5. Restart the server.

**Impact:**

If this policy is not set, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass Device Guard and run arbitrary code on the server. This could allow the attacker to take control of the server and access sensitive data.

**Additional Information:**

This vulnerability is CVE-2022-21882 and was identified in ApacheHTTPServer versions 2.4.52 and earlier. It is recommended to update to the latest version of Apache HTTP Server (2.4.53) to address this vulnerability.
