###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2017-13099 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
CVE-2017-13099 is a vulnerability in the nginx web server that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the nginx `ngx_http_parse_header_line()` function.

To fix this vulnerability, you need to upgrade to a version of nginx that has been patched against CVE-2017-13099. The following versions of nginx are patched against this vulnerability:

* nginx 1.13.10
* nginx 1.14.6
* nginx 1.15.4
* nginx 1.16.1

If you are unable to upgrade to a patched version of nginx, you can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the `ngx_http_parse_header_line()` function. To do this, add the following line to your nginx configuration file:

```
http {
  parse_header_line off;
}
```

Please note that disabling the `ngx_http_parse_header_line()` function may break some functionality of your nginx server.

CVE-2017-13099 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category **A1: Injection**. Injection vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in a command or query. This can allow attackers to inject malicious code into the application, which can then be executed.

To prevent injection vulnerabilities, it is important to sanitize all user-supplied data before using it in a command or query. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as input validation, escaping, and prepared statements.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection vulnerabilities:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
* Keep your web server and software up to date.
* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for all user accounts.
* Educate your employees about injection vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.
