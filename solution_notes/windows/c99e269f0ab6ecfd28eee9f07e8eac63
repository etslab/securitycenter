**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Implementation Flaws

**Issue Description:**

The `DisableNotifications` registry key is set to `1` in the `Software-Policies-Microsoft-WindowsFirewall-DomainProfile` location, allowing users to disable Windows Firewall notifications.

**Impact:**

* Users may be less aware of potential security threats.
* Attackers may be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the firewall without triggering notifications.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile`.
3. Locate the `DisableNotifications` DWORD value.
4. Double-click the value and set it to `0` (disabled).
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* It's recommended to restart the Windows Firewall service after making these changes.
* Organizations should consider using a group policy to manage firewall settings and prevent unauthorized modifications.
