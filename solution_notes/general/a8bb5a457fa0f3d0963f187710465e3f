**Solution:**

1. **Implement least privilege principles:** Ensure that only authorized users have access to manage policy distribution groups.

2. **Use strong authentication mechanisms:** Require strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication for users with access to group management.

3. **Regularly review and revoke access:** Periodically audit user access to policy distribution groups and revoke access for users who no longer require it.

4. **Enable logging and auditing:** Enable audit logging for policy distribution group management actions and monitor the logs for any suspicious activity.

5. **Use role-based access control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to grant specific permissions to users based on their roles and responsibilities.

6. **Limit access to sensitive data:** Restrict access to sensitive data within policy distribution groups to only those who absolutely need it.

7. **Educate users on best practices:** Provide training and awareness to users on the importance of managing policy distribution groups securely.
