###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2015-8325
CVE-2015-8325 is a vulnerability in the Apache web server that allows local users to gain privileges by triggering a buffer overflow. To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache web server to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability. You can find the latest version of the Apache web server at the Apache Software Foundation website.

CVE-2015-8325 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category of "Injection". Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or unfiltered user input is used to dynamically generate code or content. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server or inject malicious content into a web page that is then served to other users.

To prevent injection attacks, you should carefully validate and filter all user input before using it to generate code or content. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help block common injection attacks.

Here are some additional steps you can take to protect your Apache web server from CVE-2015-8325 and other vulnerabilities:

* Keep your Apache web server software up to date.
* Use a strong password for your Apache web server account.
* Enable the mod_security module for Apache.
* Use a WAF to help block common attacks.
* Monitor your Apache web server for signs of attack.

By taking these steps, you can help to protect your Apache web server from CVE-2015-8325 and other vulnerabilities.
