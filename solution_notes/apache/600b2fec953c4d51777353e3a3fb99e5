**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Policy FullPrivilegeAuditing registry key controls whether successful and failed attempts to use user rights are audited. By default, this key is set to 0 (disabled). This means that no auditing is performed for privileged operations, which makes it difficult to detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
```
3. Double-click the `FullPrivilegeAuditing` value and set it to 1.
4. Click OK.
5. Restart the server.

**Additional Information:**

Auditing privileged operations is an important security measure that helps organizations track and investigate unauthorized access attempts. By enabling this audit policy, organizations can gain visibility into who is attempting to perform privileged operations and whether those attempts are successful or not.
