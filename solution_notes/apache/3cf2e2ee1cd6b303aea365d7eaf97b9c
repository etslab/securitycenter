**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Update Apache Server:** Download and install the latest version of Apache HTTP Server from the official Apache website. This will patch the vulnerability.

2. **Verify Patch:** After updating Apache, verify that the vulnerable versions are no longer present by running the following command:

```bash
httpd -v | grep Server
```

The output should not contain "2.4.56" or any earlier versions.

3. **Disable Directory Listings:** To prevent directory listings and brute-force attacks, disable directory listings by adding the following directive to the server configuration file (usually httpd.conf):

```bash
Options -Indexes
```

4. **Restrict Access to Sensitive Directories:** Protect sensitive directories by using .htaccess files to grant access only to authorized users or roles. For example:

```bash
AuthUserFile /path/to/authfile
AuthGroupFile /dev/null
AuthName "Restricted Area"
AuthType Basic
require valid-user
```

5. **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** To prevent downgrade attacks, enable HSTS by adding the following header to the server configuration:

```bash
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" env=HTTPS
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious traffic.
* Implement security headers such as X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options.
* Regularly scan your server for vulnerabilities.
* Train your team on security best practices.
