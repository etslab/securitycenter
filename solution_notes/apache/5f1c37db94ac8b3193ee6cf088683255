**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the affected servers:** Determine which Apache servers have the vulnerable Registry key setting.
2. **Modify the Registry key:** Navigate to the following Registry key location:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
   ```
3. **Edit the Policy MaxTicketExpiry value:** Set the following value:
   ```
   Policy MaxTicketExpiry = 0xFFFFFFFF
   ```
4. **Restart the Apache service:** This will apply the Registry change.

**Explanation:**

The Policy MaxTicketExpiry Registry key controls the maximum lifetime of Kerberos tickets issued to users. If this value is set to a low value, it can result in users being logged out of their sessions prematurely. This can be a security risk, as it could allow an attacker to impersonate a valid user and gain access to sensitive data. By setting the value to 0xFFFFFFFF, the ticket lifetime is set to the maximum possible value, mitigating this risk.
