**How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2015-0204 in nginx web server**

The CVE-2015-0204 vulnerability in nginx is a remote code execution vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on the nginx server. The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the `ngx_http_read_client_request_body()` function.

To fix the CVE-2015-0204 vulnerability, you need to upgrade to a version of nginx that is not affected by the vulnerability. The following versions of nginx are not affected by the vulnerability:

* nginx 1.8.0 and later
* nginx 1.7.2 and later
* nginx 1.6.3 and later

If you are unable to upgrade to a version of nginx that is not affected by the vulnerability, you can mitigate the vulnerability by applying the following workarounds:

* Set the `client_max_body_size` directive to a lower value. This will limit the size of the request body that nginx will accept.
* Set the `fastcgi_buffers` directive to a lower value. This will limit the size of the buffers that nginx will use to store the request body.

**Which OWASP Top 10 web 2021 category does this issue belong to?**

The CVE-2015-0204 vulnerability belongs to the following OWASP Top 10 web 2021 category:

* **A1: Injection**

Injection vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web application's input. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the web server or to access sensitive data.

In the case of the CVE-2015-0204 vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious code into the request body. This code would then be executed by the nginx server.

**Recommendations**

To protect your nginx web server from the CVE-2015-0204 vulnerability, you should:

* Upgrade to a version of nginx that is not affected by the vulnerability.
* Apply the workarounds listed above if you are unable to upgrade.
* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web application from injection attacks.

You should also regularly review your web application security posture and keep your software up to date.
