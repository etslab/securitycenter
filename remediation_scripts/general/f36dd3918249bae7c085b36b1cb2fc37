####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2019-10092 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2019-10092 in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable modules are enabled
for module in mod_cgi mod_include mod_php; do
  if ! grep -q "^$module " /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/$module.conf; then
    echo "$module is not enabled."
    continue
  fi

  # Patch the vulnerable code
  sed -i -e "s/Options Indexes FollowSymLinks/Options FollowSymLinks/" /etc/apache2/mods-available/$module.conf
done

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart


This patch script will disable the `Indexes` option for the `mod_cgi`, `mod_include`, and `mod_php` modules. This will prevent Apache from serving directory listings, which is a vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers.

After applying the patch, you should restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

Here are some additional details about the vulnerabilities that this patch script addresses:

* **CVE-2013-3587** is a remote code execution vulnerability in the `mod_cgi` module. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.
* **CWE-310** is a generic vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass access controls by exploiting insecure directory listings.
* **CVE-2019-10092** is a remote code execution vulnerability in the `mod_include` module. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.

By applying this patch, you can help to protect your server from these vulnerabilities.
