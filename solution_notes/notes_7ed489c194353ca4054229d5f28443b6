**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to configure the following registry key:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\PointAndPrint
```

Create a new DWORD value named `RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators` and set its value to 1.

**Rationale:**

The Policy RestrictDriverInstallationToAdministrators setting prevents non-administrators from installing printer drivers. This helps protect against malicious code being installed on the system through a printer driver.
