**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WcmSvc\wifinetworkmanager\config`
3. Locate the `Policy AutoConnectAllowedOEM` DWORD value.
4. Set the value to 0.
5. Exit the Registry Editor.

**Explanation:**

The `Policy AutoConnectAllowedOEM` value controls whether Windows will automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks that are broadcast by OEMs. This setting is normally disabled by default, but it can be enabled by third-party software. If this setting is enabled, it could allow an attacker to connect to a Wi-Fi network without the user's knowledge or consent. This could allow the attacker to intercept network traffic or launch man-in-the-middle attacks.
