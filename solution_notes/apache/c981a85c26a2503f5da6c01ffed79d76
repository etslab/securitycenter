**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**
The android:exported attribute controls whether an Activity can be started from outside the application. Setting it to true makes the Activity visible to other applications and potentially vulnerable to malicious attacks.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, set the android:exported attribute to false in the AndroidManifest.xml file for the affected Activity:

```xml
<activity android:name="com.amazon.aps.ads.activity.ApsInterstitialActivity" android:exported="false" />
```

**Additional Explanation:**
When android:exported is set to true, any application can start the Activity, including malicious applications that might try to exploit security vulnerabilities. By setting it to false, we restrict access to the Activity only within the application, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential attacks.
