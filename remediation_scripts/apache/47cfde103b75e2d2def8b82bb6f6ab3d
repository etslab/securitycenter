####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-10708 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2016-10708 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version is installed
CURRENT_VERSION=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')
if [ "$CURRENT_VERSION" -lt "2.4.7" ]; then
  echo "Apache $CURRENT_VERSION is vulnerable to CVE-2016-10708."
  echo "Please upgrade to Apache 2.4.7 or later."
  exit 1
fi

# Patch the vulnerable code
echo "Patching vulnerable code..."
sed -i -e 's/AcceptPathInfo On/AcceptPathInfo Off/g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache..."
service apache2 restart

# Check if the patch was successful
if ! apache2 -t; then
  echo "The patch failed."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch successful."
```

This script will check if Apache is installed and running the vulnerable version. If it is, the script will patch the vulnerable code and restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the patch was successful.
