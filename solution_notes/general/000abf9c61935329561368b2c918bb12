**Severity of CVE-2016-6329:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Authentication

**Solution to Fix the Issue:**

1. **Apply Microsoft Security Updates:** Install the latest security updates from Microsoft that address CVE-2016-6329. These updates patch the vulnerability in the affected versions of IIS.

2. **Disable NTLM Authentication:** If possible, disable NTLM authentication on your web server. NTLM is the vulnerable authentication protocol that can be exploited by CVE-2016-6329.

3. **Implement Mitigation Techniques:** If you cannot disable NTLM, implement mitigation techniques such as:
   - **Disable RPC over HTTP:** Disable the RPC over HTTP protocol, which attackers can abuse to exploit CVE-2016-6329.
   - **Enable Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA):** EPA is a security feature that can help protect against downgrade attacks, including those that exploit NTLM vulnerabilities.
   - **Enable Windows Firewall:** Configure Windows Firewall to block incoming traffic on ports 135 and 139, which are used for NTLM authentication.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Regularly review and update your IIS server configuration to ensure that all security measures are in place.
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic targeting NTLM authentication.
- Use strong passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication for administrative access to your IIS server.
- Monitor your web server for suspicious activity, and promptly investigate any potential security breaches.
