**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Enable Session Cookie Protection:**
   - Add the following directive to your Apache configuration file (.htaccess or httpd.conf):
     ```
     Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
     ```
   - This forces the browser to connect to your website over HTTPS, providing protection for session cookies.

2. **Set Secure Cookie Flag:**
   - Add the `Secure` attribute to your session cookie configuration to prevent it from being sent over unencrypted HTTP connections:
     ```js
     session.cookie.secure = true;
     ```

3. **Enable HTTP-Only Cookie Flag:**
   - Add the `HttpOnly` attribute to your session cookie configuration to prevent it from being accessed by client-side scripts:
     ```js
     session.cookie.httpOnly = true;
     ```

4. **Set Appropriate Expiration Time:**
   - Configure the session expiration time to be short, e.g., 30 minutes or less, to limit the risk of session hijacking.
     ```js
     session.cookie.maxAge = 60 * 30; // 30 minutes
     ```

5. **Use Random Session IDs:**
   - Generate random and unique session IDs to prevent attackers from guessing or predicting them.
     ```
     session.cookie.genid = function(length) {
       return crypto.generatePseudoRandomBytes(length).toString('base64').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_').replace(/=+$/, '');
     };
     ```

6. **Disable Session Stored in URL:**
   - Do not store session IDs in the URL, as this can allow attackers to steal sessions. Instead, use cookies or other secure mechanisms.

7. **Implement Session Timeout:**
   - Implement a session timeout mechanism to automatically invalidate sessions that have been inactive for a certain period.

8. **Perform Periodic Security Audits:**
   - Regularly review and audit your session management configuration to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with best practices.
