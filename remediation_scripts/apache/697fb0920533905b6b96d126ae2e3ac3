####patch script to remediate  CVE-2020-11984 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2020-11984 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is vulnerable, patch it
  if [[ $apache_version -lt "2.4.44" ]]; then
    echo "Patching Apache..."
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.44.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf httpd-2.4.44.tar.gz
    cd httpd-2.4.44
    make
    cp -R * /usr/local/apache2
    echo "Restarting Apache..."
    systemctl restart apache2
  else
    echo "Apache is not vulnerable."
  fi

else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and, if it is, check the version of Apache. If Apache is vulnerable, the script will download the latest version of Apache, patch it, and restart Apache.

Please note that this is just a sample script and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs.
