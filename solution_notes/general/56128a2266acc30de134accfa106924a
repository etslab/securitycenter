**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1 - Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Disable WebDAV:** Navigate to Windows Features and turn off the WebDAV feature.

2. **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Open IIS Manager.
   - Select the website for which you want to enable HSTS.
   - In the "Security" section of the website's properties dialog box, click on "Edit..." under HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
   - Select "Enable HSTS" and specify the desired maximum age for the HSTS header (recommended: 31536000 seconds, or 1 year).

3. **Use SSL/TLS for all communications:** Ensure that all communication to and from the web server is encrypted using SSL/TLS.

4. **Limit access to sensitive data:** Restrict access to sensitive data to only authorized users and implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to monitor and block malicious requests that could exploit the vulnerability.

6. **Install security updates:** Apply all security updates from Microsoft as soon as possible.

**Additional Considerations:**

* If disabling WebDAV is not feasible, consider implementing specific access controls to limit the use of WebDAV to authorized users only.
* Regularly review and update access control configurations to ensure their effectiveness in preventing unauthorized access.
* Consider using a vulnerability scanner to regularly scan the web server for vulnerabilities and take appropriate remediation actions.
