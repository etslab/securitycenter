###How to fix the Certificates issue of cert chain of trust, failed (chain incomplete). in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the "Certificates issue of cert chain of trust, failed (chain incomplete)" error in Nginx, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the certificate chain. You can do this by running the following command:

```
openssl verify -verbose <certificate_file>
```

This will show you all of the certificates in the chain, as well as any errors that are found.

2. Identify the missing certificate. If the error message says that a certificate is missing, you will need to obtain it from the certificate authority (CA) that issued it.

3. Add the missing certificate to the Nginx configuration. Once you have the missing certificate, you need to add it to the Nginx configuration. You can do this by adding the following line to the `nginx.conf` file:

```
ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
```

4. Restart Nginx. Once you have added the missing certificate, you need to restart Nginx for the changes to take effect.

This issue falls into the **A2: Broken Authentication** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.

**Explanation:**

Broken Authentication is a security weakness that allows an attacker to compromise the authentication and authorization mechanisms of an application. This can allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to accounts, data, or functionality.

Incomplete certificate chains can be exploited by attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties and impersonates one of them. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on communication or even inject malicious content.

**Recommendations:**

* Ensure that all certificates in the certificate chain are valid and trusted.
* Use a certificate pinning mechanism to prevent attackers from substituting their own certificates for the legitimate ones.
* Keep the Nginx configuration up to date and apply security patches promptly.
