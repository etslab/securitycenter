**Problem Description:**

Policy MaximumPasswordAge in Registry System Access in the Apache server is not set to an appropriate value, allowing attackers to use expired passwords indefinitely.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy MaximumPasswordAge registry key to an appropriate value. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
    ```
3. Find the `MaximumPasswordAge` value and double-click it.
4. Set the value to the desired maximum password age in days. For example, to set the maximum password age to 90 days, enter `90` in the Value data field.
5. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The recommended maximum password age is 90 days.
* Consider implementing additional password security measures, such as requiring strong passwords and two-factor authentication.
