**Solution:**

1. **Disable the Policy EnumerateLocalUsers setting:**

   Set the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\EnumerateLocalUsers` registry value to `0`.

2. **Apply permissions to the registry key:**

   Grant only the necessary permissions to access the registry key:

   * Grant the "Read" permission to the "Administrators" group.
   * Remove any other permissions.

3. **Restart the server:**

   The changes to the registry require a server restart to take effect.

4. **Verify the fix:**

   Use the following command to verify that the setting is disabled:

   ```
   reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" /v EnumerateLocalUsers
   ```

   The output should be "0".

5. **Monitor for any changes:**

   Regularly monitor the registry setting to ensure that it has not been re-enabled.
