####patch script to remediate  CVE-2022-28615 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is the patch script to remediate CVE-2022-28615 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache HTTP Server is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache HTTP Server is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check the version of Apache HTTP Server
version=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')

# If the version is less than 2.4.54, then apply the patch
if [ "$version" -lt "2.4.54" ]; then
  echo "Applying patch for CVE-2022-28615..."
  patch -p1 < CVE-2022-28615.patch
fi

# Restart Apache HTTP Server
echo "Restarting Apache HTTP Server..."
apache2ctl restart

# Check if the patch was applied successfully
if ! grep -q "CVE-2022-28615" /usr/src/apache2/patches/CVE-2022-28615.patch; then
  echo "Patch for CVE-2022-28615 was not applied successfully."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch for CVE-2022-28615 applied successfully."
```

This patch script will check if Apache HTTP Server is installed and running. If it is, the script will check the version of Apache HTTP Server. If the version is less than 2.4.54, then the patch will be applied. After the patch is applied, Apache HTTP Server will be restarted. Finally, the script will check if the patch was applied successfully.
