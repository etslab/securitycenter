###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of gnu.tar in apache web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the App Dependencies issue of gnu.tar in Apache web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Stop Apache.
2. Remove the gnu.tar file from the Apache directory.
3. Restart Apache.

The gnu.tar file is a compressed archive that contains a number of GNU tools. These tools are not required for Apache to function, and they can sometimes cause problems. By removing the gnu.tar file, you can prevent these problems from occurring.

The App Dependencies issue of gnu.tar in Apache web server belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of **Injection**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies.

In the case of the gnu.tar file, the vulnerability is in the application's dependencies. The gnu.tar file contains a number of GNU tools that are not required for Apache to function. However, these tools can sometimes be used by attackers to inject malicious code into Apache.

By removing the gnu.tar file, you can prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. This will help to protect your Apache web server from attack.

Here are some additional tips for preventing App Dependencies issues:

* Keep your software up to date. Software vendors often release security updates to fix vulnerabilities in their software. By keeping your software up to date, you can help to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF can help to block malicious traffic from reaching your web application. This can help to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in your application's dependencies.
* Implement a security awareness program for your employees. Employees should be trained on how to identify and report suspicious activity. This can help to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in your application's dependencies.
