**Solution**:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkProvider\HardenedPaths`
3. Check for the `DisableProtection` DWORD value. If it is present and set to 1, change its value to 0.
4. If the `DisableProtection` value is not present, create a new DWORD value with that name and set its value to 0.
5. Restart the server.

This change will enable policy enforcement for network access to files and folders on the server, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.
