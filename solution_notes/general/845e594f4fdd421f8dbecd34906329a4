**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Verify the file permissions:** Ensure that the file permissions for `apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libovpnutil.so` are set correctly. It should be owned by a non-privileged user and have appropriate read/write/execute permissions.

2. **Check for world-readable files:** Examine the directories leading to the file to ensure that none of them are world-readable. If any directories are world-readable, restrict the permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Review Apache configuration:** Inspect the Apache configuration files to confirm that the file `apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libovpnutil.so` is not exposed to the internet directly. It should be placed in a restricted directory that is not accessible by external users.

4. **Utilize file access control mechanisms:** Implement file access control mechanisms, such as Access Control Lists (ACLs), to restrict access to the file to only authorized users or processes.

5. **Update vulnerable components:** If the file `apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libovpnutil.so` is part of a library or framework, ensure that it is up-to-date and patched against any known vulnerabilities.

6. **Disable unused Apache modules:** If the file is associated with an unused Apache module, disable the module to remove unnecessary exposure.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities related to file permissions and access control.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to monitor and block unauthorized access to sensitive files.
* Implement best practices for hardening the Apache server and its configuration to prevent unauthorized access.
