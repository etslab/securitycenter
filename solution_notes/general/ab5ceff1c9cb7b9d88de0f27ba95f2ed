**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Description:**

The Policy AuditSystemEvents registry setting configures the audit policy for system events on a Windows Server. By default, this setting is not enabled, meaning that system events are not being audited. This can make it difficult to detect and respond to security incidents, as system events often contain valuable information about security-relevant activities.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to enable the Policy AuditSystemEvents registry setting. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security
    ```
3. In the right pane, locate the Policy AuditSystemEvents value.
4. Double-click on the Policy AuditSystemEvents value and change its value data to 1.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* You may need to restart the Security log service for the changes to take effect.
* By enabling Registry Event Audit, you can improve your organization's security posture by detecting and responding to security incidents more effectively.
