**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not applicable

**Issue Description:**
The `javascript:S125` rule in SonarQube flags code that uses `eval()`. The `eval()` function can be used to execute arbitrary code, posing a security risk.

**Solution:**
There are several ways to avoid using `eval()`. One option is to use the `Function` constructor instead:

```javascript
// Original code
var result = eval('(1 + 2) * 3;');

// Rewrite using the Function constructor
var result = new Function('return (1 + 2) * 3;')();
```

Another option is to use a safer alternative to `eval()`, such as `JSON.parse()`. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Original code
var result = eval('{"name": "John"}');

// Rewrite using JSON.parse()
var result = JSON.parse('{"name": "John"}');
```

In some cases, it may not be possible to avoid using `eval()`. If this is the case, you should take steps to mitigate the security risk, such as:

* Restricting the input to `eval()` to a trusted source
* Sandboxing the code executed by `eval()`

**Additional Notes:**

This issue is considered medium severity because `eval()` can be used to execute arbitrary code, which could potentially lead to a security breach. However, it is important to note that this issue is not specific to Apache and can occur in any application that uses JavaScript.
