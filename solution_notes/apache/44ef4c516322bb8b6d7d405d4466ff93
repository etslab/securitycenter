###How to fix the API Threats issue of Server Leaks Information via X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field(s)
The X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field is a non-standard header that is often included by default in responses constructed via a particular scripting technology. It can be used by attackers to identify the technology that is being used to run the web server, which can then be used to target known vulnerabilities in that technology.

To fix this issue, you can disable the X-Powered-By header in your Apache configuration file. The following line of code will do this:

```
Header unset X-Powered-By
```

This will prevent the X-Powered-By header from being included in any responses generated by Apache.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of **Information Exposure**. This category includes vulnerabilities that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or intellectual property.

By fixing this issue, you can help to protect your web server from attack and prevent the disclosure of sensitive information.

Here are some additional tips for protecting your web server from attack:

* Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your system from known vulnerabilities.
* Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to your web server.
* Use strong passwords and change them regularly.
* Be careful about what information you share on your website. Avoid sharing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your web server safe from attack.
