####patch script to remediate  CVE-2021-39275 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2021-39275 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $3}')

  # If Apache is version 2.4.48 or earlier, then patch it
  if [[ $apache_version -le 2.4.48 ]]; then

    # Download the patch
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/CVE-2021-39275.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2021-39275.patch

    # Restart Apache
    sudo service apache2 restart

  fi

fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and, if it is, it will check the version of Apache. If Apache is version 2.4.48 or earlier, then the script will download a patch from the Apache website and apply it. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

Please note that this is just a basic patch script. It may not work for all configurations of Apache. If you are unsure about how to apply the patch, please consult the Apache documentation or contact your system administrator.
