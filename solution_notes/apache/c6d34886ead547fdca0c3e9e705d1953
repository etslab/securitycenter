**Severity: Critical**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category: Sensitive Data Exposure**

**Solution:**

1. **Install Latest Security Updates:** Ensure that the Apache server is up to date with the latest security patches.
2. **Disable Policy Central Access Policy Staging:** In the Apache server configuration file (httpd.conf):
    - Locate the following line:
      ```
      LoadModule authnz_ldap_module modules/mod_authnz_ldap.so
      ```
    - Add the following line below it:
      ```
      LDAPReferrals Off
      ```
3. **Set Appropriate Access Control Rules:**
    - Configure the Apache server to restrict access to the protected resources using appropriate access control rules.
4. **Harden Apache Server Configuration:**
    - Disable unnecessary modules and features in the Apache server configuration to reduce the attack surface.
    - Configure rate limiting and IP address blacklisting to prevent brute-force attacks.
5. **Monitor Regularly:**
    - Regularly monitor Apache server logs for suspicious activity and audit the configuration to ensure it remains secure.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue allows attackers to bypass authentication and access sensitive data.
* It is recommended to apply the fix promptly to mitigate the security risk.
* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to further protect the Apache server from malicious attacks.
