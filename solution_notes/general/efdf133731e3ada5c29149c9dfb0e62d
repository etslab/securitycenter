**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A03: Injection

**Description:**

The zlib library in Apache Server contains a vulnerability (CVE-2018-1000031) that allows an attacker to trigger an integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow in the `zipOpenNewFileInZip4_6` function. This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the affected server.

**Solution:**

The issue has been fixed in zlib version 1.2.11. To mitigate the risk, it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of zlib.

**Steps to Upgrade zlib:**

1. Download the latest version of zlib from the official website.
2. Unpack the downloaded file.
3. Navigate to the `zlib` directory.
4. Run the following commands:

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

5. Restart the Apache Server.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* Use input validation to ensure that user-supplied data does not contain malicious characters that could trigger the vulnerability.
* Implement HTTP headers such as `Content-Length` and `Content-Type` to prevent attackers from uploading malicious files.
* Enable firewall rules to block unauthorized access to the server.
