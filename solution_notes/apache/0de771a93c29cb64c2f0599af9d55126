###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2021-39275
CVE-2021-39275 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. It can be exploited by an attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) or to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the httpd user.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache HTTP Server to a version that is not affected. The Apache Software Foundation has released security updates for all affected versions.

You can also mitigate the risk of this vulnerability by configuring your Apache HTTP Server to only allow trusted users to access it. You should also use a firewall to block access to your Apache HTTP Server from unauthorized users.

CVE-2021-39275 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of "Injection". Injection flaws occur when unvalidated or unfiltered data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Here are some additional tips to help you protect your Apache HTTP Server from vulnerabilities:

* Keep your Apache HTTP Server software up to date.
* Use a firewall to block access to your Apache HTTP Server from unauthorized users.
* Configure your Apache HTTP Server to only allow trusted users to access it.
* Use strong passwords for your Apache HTTP Server accounts.
* Enable mod_security to help protect your Apache HTTP Server from common attacks.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your Apache HTTP Server from even more sophisticated attacks.

By following these tips, you can help protect your Apache HTTP Server from vulnerabilities and keep your website safe from attack.
