####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 CSP: script-src unsafe-inline in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 CSP: script-src unsafe-inline in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Get the current Apache version
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # Check if the current Apache version is vulnerable
  if [ "$apache_version" -lt "2.4.6" ]; then

    # Patch the Apache configuration file
    echo "### Patching Apache configuration file ###"
    sed -i "s/script-src 'unsafe-inline'/script-src 'self'/" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    # Restart Apache
    echo "### Restarting Apache ###"
    sudo service apache2 restart

    echo "### Patching complete ###"
  else
    echo "### Apache is not vulnerable ###"
  fi

else
  echo "### Apache is not running ###"
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current Apache version and check if it is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169. If the Apache version is vulnerable, the script will patch the Apache configuration file to disable the `unsafe-inline` directive for the `script-src` directive. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

It is important to note that this patch script is only a temporary solution. The best way to protect your Apache server from CVE-2013-0169 is to upgrade to a version of Apache that is not vulnerable.
