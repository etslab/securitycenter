The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is **A1 - Injection**. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and command injection, occur when unvalidated user input is used to dynamically generate SQL statements or other commands. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive data.

Here are some additional tips to help you prevent App Dependencies issues:

* Keep your software up to date. Software vendors often release security updates to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF can help to block common attack vectors, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* Implement input validation. Input validation is a critical security measure that can help to prevent injection attacks.
* Educate your users. Users should be aware of the risks of entering sensitive information into websites and should be careful about what links they click on.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your Apache web server from App Dependencies issues and other security vulnerabilities.
