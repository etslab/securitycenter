###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2012-4929 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
CVE-2012-4929 is a vulnerability in the nginx web server that allows attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to protected resources. It is classified as a Broken Authentication vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021.

To fix CVE-2012-4929, you need to upgrade to a version of nginx that is no longer affected by the vulnerability. The latest version of nginx is 1.23.0, and it is recommended that you upgrade to this version or a newer version as soon as possible.

If you are unable to upgrade to a version of nginx that is no longer affected by CVE-2012-4929, you can mitigate the vulnerability by implementing the following workarounds:

* Disable the `http_auth_digest` module.
* Enable the `http_ssl_module` and use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic to and from your nginx server.
* Configure nginx to use a strong password hashing algorithm, such as Argon2 or bcrypt.
* Implement two-factor authentication for all users of your nginx server.

Here are the steps to upgrade nginx to the latest version:

1. Stop the nginx service.
2. Download the latest version of nginx from the nginx website.
3. Extract the nginx archive to a temporary directory.
4. Configure nginx using the `./configure` script.
5. Make nginx using the `make` command.
6. Install nginx using the `sudo make install` command.
7. Start the nginx service.

Once you have upgraded nginx, you should verify that the vulnerability has been fixed by running the following command:

```
nginx -T
```

If the output of the command does not contain any errors, then the vulnerability has been fixed.

It is important to note that workarounds are not a long-term solution to security vulnerabilities. It is always best to upgrade to a version of the software that is no longer affected by the vulnerability as soon as possible.
