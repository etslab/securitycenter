**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not applicable (this issue is not directly related to any OWASP Top 10 2021 category)

**Solution:**

The Policy EnableNetbios registry setting determines whether NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) is enabled for DNS clients. NetBT is a legacy protocol that allows Windows computers to communicate with each other using their NetBIOS names. However, it can be exploited to perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and other malicious activities.

To fix the issue, disable the Policy EnableNetbios setting by following these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit)
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient
```
3. Find the **EnableNetbios** value and double-click it
4. Change the Value data to **0** and click OK
5. Close the Registry Editor

**Impact of the Issue:**

Enabling NetBIOS can increase the attack surface of the server by exposing it to potential vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to perform DoS attacks, obtain sensitive information, or even gain unauthorized access to the server.

**Recommendation:**

It is recommended to disable NetBIOS if it is not required. Disabling NetBIOS reduces the risk of attacks and improves the overall security of the server.
