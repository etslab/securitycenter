**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A9: Security Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Issue:** APK files are packaged Android applications used commonly in Android devices. apktool_out/lib/x86/libnms.so is a shared library found within APK files that could contain native C/C++ code. When this file is exposed on an Apache server, it can be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary code on the server.

2. **Fix the Issue:** To resolve this issue, restrict access to the apktool_out/lib/x86/libnms.so file by properly configuring Apache server's directory permissions.

3. **Apache Server Configuration:**
   - Edit the Apache server's configuration file (httpd.conf or similar).
   - Locate the directory where the APK files are located (e.g., /var/www/html/apk-files)
   - Add the following directives:

```
<Directory /var/www/html/apk-files>
    Require all denied
</Directory>
```

4. **Restart Apache Server:** Once the configuration is updated, restart the Apache server for changes to take effect.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Use a web application firewall (WAF) to monitor and block malicious requests targeting the exposed file.
- Regularly review and update Apache server configurations to ensure optimal security posture.
- Follow best practices for secure Apache server management, such as using strong passwords, enabling SSL/TLS, and applying security patches promptly.
