**Severity:** High

**Detailed Solution:**

You need to enable detailed tracking of user activity in the registry. This can be done by setting the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection` registry key to "1". This will log all registry activity to the Event Viewer under the "Microsoft-Windows-DataCollection/Operational" log.

You can also use a third-party tool such as Sysmon to monitor registry activity. Sysmon is a free tool that can be downloaded from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.
