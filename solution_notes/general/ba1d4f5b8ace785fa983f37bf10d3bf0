**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Issue Description:**

The PHP code in `dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php` does not properly sanitize user input, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the code uses `mysql_real_escape_string()` to sanitize user input, which is no longer recommended as it does not protect against all types of SQL injection attacks.

**Impact:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to compromised data or disruption of service.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, use a more robust sanitization method, such as `mysqli_real_escape_string()` or prepared statements.

Here is an example using prepared statements:

```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```

**Additional Notes:**

* Update your PHP version to the latest version, which includes more advanced security features.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your application from malicious requests.
* Regularly test your application for vulnerabilities using penetration testing tools.
