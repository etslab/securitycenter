**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description:**

The Policy registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkProvider\HardenedPaths` contains insecure settings for NETLOGON. This can allow unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in NETLOGON shares.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkProvider\HardenedPaths
```

2. Right-click on the NETLOGON key and select "Modify."

3. In the "Value data" field, ensure that the following value is set:
```
AllowInsecureGuestAuth=0
```

4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

5. Restart the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The default value for `AllowInsecureGuestAuth` is 1, which allows insecure guest authentication. Setting it to 0 disables insecure guest authentication.
* This issue falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Sensitive Data Exposure because it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data stored in NETLOGON shares.
