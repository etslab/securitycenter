**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A6: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Update Capacitor:** Ensure that the latest version of Capacitor is installed. Capacitor versions prior to 3.4.0 contain a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to access sensitive data.

2. **Enable Data Security:** Add the following code to the `capacitor.config.json` file to enable data security:

```json
"dataSecurity": {
  "enabled": true
}
```

3. **Update Native Plugins:** Update all native plugins to their latest versions. Outdated plugins may contain vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data.

4. **Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Regularly scan your application for vulnerabilities using a security scanner, such as the Synopsys Black Duck scanner or the OWASP ZAP tool.

5. **Implement Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent sensitive data exposure, such as input validation, data encryption, and proper error handling.

**Additional Mitigation Recommendations:**

* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as using a WAF (Web Application Firewall) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System).
* Educate developers about the importance of data security and secure coding practices.
* Monitor application logs for any suspicious activity or data exposure attempts.
