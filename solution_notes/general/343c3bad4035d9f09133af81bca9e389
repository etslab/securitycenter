**Solution:**

1. **Disable Directory Service Access:**
   - Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf).
   - Locate the `DirectoryIndex` directive and add the following line:
     ```
     DirectoryIndex index.html /filename.txt /secret.txt /other_allowed_directories
     ```
   - Restart Apache.

2. **Use an Authorization File:**
   - Create an authorization file (e.g., .htaccess) with the following content:
     ```
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "Restricted Area"
     AuthUserFile /path/to/passwords.txt
     Require valid-user
     ```
   - Place the authorization file in the directory you want to protect.
   - Create a password file (e.g., passwords.txt) with valid usernames and passwords.
   - Restart Apache.

3. **Enforce HTTPS:**
   - Enable SSL/TLS on your server and redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
   - Use an SSL certificate that is valid and trusted by clients.

4. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Add a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to your website to restrict the loading of content from other sources.
   - For example:
     ```
     header('Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:');
     ```

5. **Remove Unnecessary Files and Directories:**
   - Review the contents of the server's directories and remove any sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible.
   - Delete any unnecessary subdirectories that may be exposing sensitive information.
