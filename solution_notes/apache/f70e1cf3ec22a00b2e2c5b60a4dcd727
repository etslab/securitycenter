* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help prevent attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's code or configuration.
* Keep the application's software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect against known vulnerabilities.
* Use strong passwords and authentication mechanisms to protect the application.
* Implement proper input validation to help prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the application.
* Monitor the application for signs of attack, such as unusual traffic patterns or changes in system behavior.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your Apache web server from the App Dependencies issue of cli.exe and other security vulnerabilities.
