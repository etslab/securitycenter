**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The PolicyVersion subkey in Registry Software->Policies->Microsoft->WindowsFirewall determines the version of the Windows Firewall policy. If the PolicyVersion subkey is not set or is set to an incorrect value, the Windows Firewall may not be able to enforce the correct security policy. This could allow attackers to bypass the firewall and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall`
3. Create or modify the PolicyVersion subkey.
4. Set the value of the PolicyVersion subkey to 2.
5. Exit the Registry Editor.

**Additional Information:**

* The recommended PolicyVersion value is 2.
* This issue does not affect all versions of Windows.
* It is important to note that this solution only addresses the audit issue related to the PolicyVersion subkey. Other security measures may still be necessary to fully protect the system from attacks.
