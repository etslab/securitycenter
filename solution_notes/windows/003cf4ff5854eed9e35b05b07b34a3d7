**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Reasoning:**

The Policy CrashOnAuditFail setting controls whether the system should crash if an audit event cannot be logged. If this setting is set to 0 (disabled), audit events may be lost, potentially compromising system integrity and making it difficult to detect malicious activity.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, enable the Policy CrashOnAuditFail setting by setting the following registry key to 1:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
Value: CrashOnAuditFail
Type: REG_DWORD
Data: 1
```

**Additional Mitigation:**

* Implement robust logging and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that all critical events are captured and analyzed.
* Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity or events that may indicate a compromise.
* Consider using a centralized logging and monitoring platform to improve visibility and analysis capabilities.
