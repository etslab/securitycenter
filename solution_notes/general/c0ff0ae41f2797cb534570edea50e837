CVE-2022-29404 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server's mod_lua module. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of a default limit on the size of the input body that can be parsed by the r:parsebody() function. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request with a large body size, which can cause the server to crash.

This vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of "Injection." Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated or malicious input is injected into an application, resulting in unexpected or unintended behavior. Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or disrupt application functionality.

To mitigate the risk of injection vulnerabilities, it is important to properly validate and sanitize all input before it is used by an application. This can be done by using input filters, parameter binding, and other techniques. It is also important to keep applications up to date with the latest security patches, as these patches often address known injection vulnerabilities.
