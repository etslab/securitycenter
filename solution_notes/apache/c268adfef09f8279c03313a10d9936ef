2. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
3. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\LAPS
```

4. Right-click on the `LAPS` key and select **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
5. Name the new value **PolicyADPasswordEncryptionEnabled**.
6. Double-click on the `PolicyADPasswordEncryptionEnabled` value and set its value to **1**.
7. Click **OK** to save the changes.
8. Close the Registry Editor.
9. Restart the Apache server.

**Explanation:**

The Policy ADPasswordEncryptionEnabled registry value specifies whether password encryption is enabled for Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS). LAPS is a Microsoft tool that helps to secure local administrator accounts by managing and rotating their passwords. When password encryption is enabled, LAPS encrypts the local administrator password in Active Directory. This helps to protect the password from being stolen or compromised.

If Policy ADPasswordEncryptionEnabled is set to 0, LAPS will not encrypt the local administrator password. This means that the password will be stored in plain text in Active Directory, which could make it vulnerable to attack.

By setting Policy ADPasswordEncryptionEnabled to 1, you can help to protect the local administrator password from being stolen or compromised. This will help to improve the security of your Apache server.
