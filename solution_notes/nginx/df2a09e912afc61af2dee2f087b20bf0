CVE-2021-33193 is a vulnerability in the nginx web server that allows an attacker to bypass validation and forward a crafted method through mod_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache poisoning. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.48.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade to the latest version of nginx. If you are unable to upgrade, you can apply the following workaround:

1. Open the nginx configuration file.
2. Find the line that starts with "proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method".
3. Change the value of the "X-Forwarded-Method" header to "CONNECT".
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Restart the nginx service.

This workaround will prevent the attacker from being able to bypass validation and forward a crafted method through mod_proxy.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of "Injection". Injection flaws occur when unvalidated or unfiltered data is inserted into an application. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* Sanitize all user input before inserting it into an application.
* Use a secure coding framework to help you write code that is resistant to injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks.
