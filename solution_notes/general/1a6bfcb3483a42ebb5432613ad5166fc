**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard
   ```

2. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity`.

3. Set the value data to `1`.

4. Restart the server.

**Justification:**

Enabling Virtualization Based Security (VBS) strengthens the server's defense against malicious attacks by isolating security-critical components from the rest of the operating system. VBS creates a secure enclave that shields the guest operating system and virtual machine monitor from manipulation by malicious software.

By default, VBS is disabled. Enabling it significantly enhances the server's security posture by preventing attackers from compromising the guest operating system, disrupting system processes, or exfiltrating sensitive information.
