**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Install the latest security updates from Microsoft:**
   - Download and install the latest security updates for Microsoft Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog.
   - For Windows Server 2008 R2: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4049090
   - For Windows Server 2012: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4049091
   - For Windows Server 2016: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4049093
   - For Windows Server 2019: https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4049094

2. **Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header:**
   - Configure IIS to add the HSTS header to all HTTP responses. This forces browsers to use HTTPS for all subsequent requests, mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - To enable HSTS, open the IIS Management Console, select the website, click on "SSL Settings", and check the "Require HTTPS" option.

3. **Disable unnecessary HTTP header fields:**
   - Remove or disable any HTTP header fields that are not necessary for your application to function correctly. This reduces the risk of information disclosure attacks.
   - To disable unnecessary HTTP header fields, open the IIS Management Console, select the website, click on "HTTP Response Headers", and remove any unnecessary headers.

4. **Implement role-based access control:**
   - Configure IIS to implement role-based access control (RBAC), which restricts access to sensitive files and directories based on user roles. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected resources.
   - To implement RBAC, open the IIS Management Console, select the website, click on "Authorization", and configure the necessary roles and permissions.

5. **Configure request filtering:**
   - Enable request filtering in IIS to protect against malicious requests and prevent data loss. This can be done by configuring URL authorization rules, file upload restrictions, and other security settings.
   - To configure request filtering, open the IIS Management Console, select the website, click on "Request Filtering", and configure the desired settings.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep your IIS server and operating system up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly scan your website for vulnerabilities using security tools.
* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against external attacks.
