CVE-2014-3566 is a vulnerability in nginx that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way that nginx handles certain types of requests.

To fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2014-3566 in nginx web server, you can do any of the following:

1. **Upgrade to a version of nginx that is not affected by the vulnerability.** The vulnerability was fixed in nginx versions 1.4.6, 1.6.1, and 1.7.9.
2. **Apply a patch to the affected version of nginx.** Patches are available for nginx versions 1.4.0 and later.
3. **Configure nginx to disable the affected functionality.** This can be done by setting the `ngx_http_fastcgi_module` directive to `off` in the nginx configuration file.
4. **Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect the nginx server.** A WAF can be used to filter out requests that are known to exploit the vulnerability.

CVE-2014-3566 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category of **A1: Injection**. Injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. The malicious code is then executed by the web application, which can give the attacker control over the application or the system on which it is running.

Here are some additional tips for preventing CVE-2014-3566 attacks:

* **Keep nginx up to date.** Apply security patches as soon as they are released.
* **Use a strong password for the nginx administration interface.**
* **Restrict access to the nginx administration interface to authorized users.**
* **Use a WAF to protect the nginx server.**
* **Implement input validation on all user input.** This will help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the web application.
