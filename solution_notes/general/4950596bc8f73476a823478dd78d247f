**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Details:**

The bWAPP/ba_captcha_bypass.php script in bWAPP-Test allows an attacker to bypass the CAPTCHA validation by directly accessing the submit.php script. This can lead to unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, ensure that the submit.php script is only accessible after the CAPTCHA validation has been successfully completed. This can be achieved by adding the following code to the script:

```php
if (!isset($_POST['captcha']) || $_POST['captcha'] != $captcha) {
    header('Location: ba_captcha.php');
    exit;
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The `Web:ImgWithoutAltCheck` SonarQube rule identifies HTML images that do not have an `alt` attribute. While this rule is unrelated to the security issue, it should be addressed to improve the accessibility of the web application.
* It is recommended to perform regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities like this one.
