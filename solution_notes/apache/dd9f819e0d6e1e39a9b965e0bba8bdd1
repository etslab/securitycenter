**Solution:**

1. **LockoutDuration:** This registry setting controls the number of minutes an account is locked out after a specified number of failed login attempts. It is recommended to set this value to a non-zero value to prevent brute-force attacks.

2. **Navigate to the Registry Editor:**

   - Press `Windows Key + R` to open the Run dialog box.
   - Type `regedit` and click "OK".

3. **Locate the Registry Key:**

   - Navigate to the following registry key:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\AccountLockoutDuration
     ```

4. **Set the LockoutDuration Value:**

   - Right-click on the `LockoutDuration` value and select "Modify".
   - Set the "Value data" to a non-zero value (e.g., 5 minutes = 5).
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

5. **Restart the Server:**

   - Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

By implementing these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of brute-force attacks against the Apache server by locking out accounts after a specified number of failed login attempts.
