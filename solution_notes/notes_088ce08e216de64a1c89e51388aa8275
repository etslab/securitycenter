**Description:**

The `css:S4658` rule flags CSS files that contain vendor-specific prefixes, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Vendor-specific prefixes are often removed or modified by browsers, which can result in unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, remove all vendor-specific prefixes from the CSS file. For example, instead of:

```css
-moz-border-radius: 10px;
-webkit-border-radius: 10px;
-o-border-radius: 10px;
border-radius: 10px;
```

Use only the standard CSS property:

```css
border-radius: 10px;
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This rule is only applicable to CSS files.
* It is recommended to use a linter or other automated tool to help identify and remove vendor-specific prefixes.
* Avoiding vendor-specific prefixes helps improve cross-browser compatibility and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
