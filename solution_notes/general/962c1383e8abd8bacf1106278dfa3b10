**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Issue Description:**

The Registry LogonLogoff policy group in the Apache server allows users to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to SSRF attacks.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, disable the Registry LogonLogoff policy group by following these steps:

1. Open the Apache configuration file, typically `httpd.conf` or `conf/httpd.conf`.
2. Locate the following line:

```
Include conf/extra/httpd-registry.conf
```

3. Comment out the line by adding a hash (#) at the beginning:

```
# Include conf/extra/httpd-registry.conf
```

4. Save and restart the Apache server.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* Implement input validation and encoding to prevent arbitrary code execution.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests.
* Regularly patch and update Apache server to address any vulnerabilities.
