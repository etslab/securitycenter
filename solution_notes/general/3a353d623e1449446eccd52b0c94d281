**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Solution:**

**1. Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**

* Add the following header to your web server configuration:

```
Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

This enforces HTTPS communication for your website, mitigating the risk of cross-site scripting attacks.

**2. Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Protection**

* Configure your server to restrict cross-origin requests by adding the following headers:

```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-CSRF-Token"
```

This prevents malicious scripts from being loaded from other domains.

**3. Validate and Sanitize User Input**

* Use input validation to ensure that user input is valid and free of malicious characters.
* Sanitize input by using OWASP's ESAPI or similar libraries to escape or remove special characters that could be interpreted as script tags.

**4. Use an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

* Implement an IDS to detect and block malicious requests attempting to exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

**5. Educate Developers**

* Train developers on the dangers of XSS and provide resources and guidelines for writing secure code.
