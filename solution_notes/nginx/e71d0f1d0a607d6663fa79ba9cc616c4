###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the Web Threats issue of Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the nginx configuration file. This file is usually located in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.
2. Find the section for your website. This section will be named after your website's domain name.
3. Add the following line to the section:

```
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
```

This will tell browsers to always use HTTPS when connecting to your website.

The Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header is a security feature that tells browsers to only connect to your website using HTTPS. This helps to protect your website from man-in-the-middle attacks, which are a type of attack where an attacker intercepts traffic between your website and the user's browser.

The HSTS header belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of Cryptographic Failures. This category includes risks that are caused by insecure cryptographic implementations or configurations.

Here are some additional tips for improving the security of your nginx web server:

* Use a strong password for your nginx server.
* Keep your nginx software up to date.
* Use a firewall to protect your nginx server from unauthorized access.
* Implement other security measures, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, to further protect your nginx server.

By following these steps, you can help to keep your nginx web server secure and protect your website from attack.
