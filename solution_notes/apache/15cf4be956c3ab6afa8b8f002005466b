**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2 - Broken Authentication

**Issue Description:**

The `bWAPP/ba_forgotten.php` file in Apache server contains a vulnerability that allows attackers to reset a user's password without providing proper authentication.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can implement the following measures:

* **Verify User Identity:** Ensure that the user's identity is properly verified before allowing them to reset their password. This can be done through methods such as email verification or two-factor authentication.
* **Enforce Password Complexity:** Implement rules to enforce strong password complexity, such as requiring a minimum length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* **Limit Password Reset Attempts:** Restrict the number of password reset attempts a user can make within a specific time frame to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **Use a Password Reset Token:** Generate a unique password reset token and send it to the user's email address. The user must enter this token to complete the password reset process.
* **Disable Account After Multiple Failed Attempts:** Disable the user's account after a certain number of failed password reset attempts to prevent automated attacks.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Regularly Audit and Patch:** Perform regular security audits to identify and patch any vulnerabilities in your web application.
* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to block malicious traffic and protect your application from attacks.
* **Educate Users:** Inform your users about the importance of using strong passwords and being cautious when clicking on suspicious links or emails.
