**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Limit Regular Expression Complexity:**
   - Use the `regexp.Compile` function with the `syntax.MaxParenCount` option to specify the maximum number of parenthesized subexpressions allowed in the regular expression.
   - Use libraries like `github.com/karrick/godir` to provide a more structured and secure way to define and use regular expressions.

2. **Use Prepared Statements:**
   - Prepare database queries using parameterized statements to prevent injection attacks. This ensures that regular expressions are not evaluated from user input.

3. **Validate Input:**
   - Sanitize and validate user input before passing it to a regular expression. Remove any potentially malicious characters or sequences.

4. **Denylist Unsafe Patterns:**
   - Define a list of unsafe regular expression patterns that are known to be vulnerable to attacks. Denylist these patterns and reject any input that matches them.

5. **Enable modsecurity:**
   - ModSecurity is a web application firewall that can be configured to protect against regular expression denial of service attacks. It can limit the number of regex matches per request and the memory used for parsing regexes.

6. **Monitor Resource Utilization:**
   - Monitor server resource utilization, such as memory and CPU usage, to detect potential denial of service attacks caused by regular expression parsing.

**Example Code:**

```go
import (
	"log"
	"regexp"
	"regexp/syntax"

	"github.com/karrick/godir/match"
)

const maxParens = 10

func main() {
	// Compile regexp with limited paren count
	re, err := regexp.Compile("^.*$", syntax.MaxParenCount(maxParens))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Use structured pattern matching
	pattern := match.Pattern(`^(?P<username>[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)$`)

	// Validate input
	input := "admin"
	if !re.MatchString(input) || !pattern.MatchString(input) {
		log.Println("Invalid input:", input)
		return
	}

	// Use prepared statements for SQL queries
	// ...

	// ...
}
```

By following these recommendations, you can limit the memory usage and mitigate the risk of denial of service attacks caused by regular expression parsing.
