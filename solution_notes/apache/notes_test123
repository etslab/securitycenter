**Solution:**

**Enable Cache-Control Header**

1. Open the IIS Manager.
2. Navigate to the website or virtual directory where you want to configure the cache-control header.
3. Select the website or virtual directory and double-click the "HTTP Response Headers" feature in the middle pane.
4. In the "HTTP Response Headers" dialog box, add the following headers:
    - Cache-Control: public
    - Expires: <date> (e.g., Expires: Wed, 1 Jan 2038 00:00:00 GMT)
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Alternatively, you can use the following steps if you prefer to use a PowerShell command:**

1. Open a PowerShell window as administrator.
2. Run the following command to enable the cache-control header for all websites:
    ```powershell
    Set-WebConfigurationProperty -Filter "system.webServer/staticContent" -Name "cacheControlHeader" -Value "public"
    ```
3. Run the following command to set the expiration date for all websites:
    ```powershell
    Set-WebConfigurationProperty -Filter "system.webServer/staticContent" -Name "cacheExpirationTime" -Value "Wed, 1 Jan 2038 00:00:00 GMT"
    ```

**Explanation:**

A missing or incomplete Cache-Control header indicates that the server is not providing instructions on how to cache the response. This can lead to performance issues and potential security vulnerabilities, as the server may not be caching sensitive data properly.

By configuring the Cache-Control header, you can instruct the browser or proxy server on how to cache the response, which can speed up page load times and reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure. The "public" value indicates that the response can be cached by any client, and the "Expires" directive specifies how long the response should be cached.
