**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected keys:** Determine which registry keys are being accessed with excessive privileges.
2. **Restrict access:** Use the following steps to restrict access to the identified registry keys:
   - Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to the affected registry key.
   - Right-click on the key and select "Permissions".
   - In the "Permissions" dialog box, click on the "Add" button.
   - Enter the name of the user or group that needs restricted access.
   - Select the "Deny" checkbox for the "Full Control" permission.
   - Click on the "OK" button to save the changes.
3. **Consider using Group Policy Preferences:** Group Policy Preferences can be used to set registry key permissions across multiple servers. This can help to simplify the process of restricting access to registry keys.
4. **Monitor for changes:** Regularly monitor the affected registry keys to ensure that they are not modified without authorization.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider using a least-privilege approach for service accounts.
* Regularly review and update system security patches.
* Implement security controls to detect and prevent unauthorized registry modifications.
