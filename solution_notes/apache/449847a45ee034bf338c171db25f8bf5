**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Solution:**

1. **Update Apache HTTP Server:** Upgrade to Apache HTTP Server version 2.2.17 or later, which includes the fix for this vulnerability.

2. **Disable CGI Processing:** If you do not need CGI processing, disable it by editing the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) and adding the following line:

   ```
   Options -ExecCGI
   ```

3. **Limit CGI File Access:** If you need CGI processing, restrict access to only the necessary files by using the `AddHandler` directive in the Apache configuration file. For example:

   ```
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .py
   ```

4. **Configure EscapeProcessing:** Enable escape processing for all CGI scripts by adding the following line to the Apache configuration file:

   ```
   EscapeProcessing On
   ```

5. **Disable TRACE Method:** Disable the TRACE method by adding the following line to the Apache configuration file:

   ```
   <LimitExcept GET HEAD POST PUT DELETE>
   Order deny,allow
   Deny all
   </LimitExcept>
   ```

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
* It is important to apply the fix promptly to prevent potential attacks.
* Regular security audits and updates are recommended to maintain a secure server configuration.
