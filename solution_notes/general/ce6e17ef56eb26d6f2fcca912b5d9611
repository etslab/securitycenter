**Severity:** Low

**Category:** Security misconfiguration

**Solution:**

Modify the Dockerfile to include the following line:

```
RUN usermod -u 1001 www-data
```

This will ensure that the user running the Apache web server (www-data) has a different UID than the user running the SonarQube process (1001).

**Explanation:**

The docker:S6587 rule detects when the user running the web server and the user running the SonarQube process have the same UID. This can be a security risk because it allows the SonarQube process to access files that should only be accessible to the web server. By changing the UID of the web server user, we can mitigate this risk.
