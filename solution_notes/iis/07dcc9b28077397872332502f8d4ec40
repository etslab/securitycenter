**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

**Solution:**

1. **Install an up-to-date SSL/TLS Certificate:**
   - Obtain a certificate from a reputable certificate authority (CA).
   - Ensure that the certificate is valid and has not expired.

2. **Enable HTTPS Only:**
   - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS using a 301 redirect.
   - Configure your web server (IIS) to only accept HTTPS connections.

3. **Configure Strong Cipher Suites:**
   - Disable weak cipher suites that are vulnerable to attacks, such as SSLv3 and TLS 1.0.
   - Enable strong cipher suites like AES-256-GCM and TLS 1.3.

4. **Configure TLS 1.3:**
   - Enable TLS 1.3, which is the latest and most secure TLS protocol.
   - Ensure that your server and client support TLS 1.3.

5. **Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Add an HSTS header to your responses. This header instructs browsers to only access your site over HTTPS.
   - Set a long HSTS max-age value (e.g., 31536000 seconds).

6. **Use X-Content-Type-Options:**
   - Add an X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header to prevent browsers from sniffing and potentially misinterpreting the content type.

7. **Scan and Test Regularly:**
   - Perform regular scans to identify security vulnerabilities, including certificate issues.
   - Test your site with security testing tools to verify that it is configured securely.

**Note:** The specific configuration steps may vary depending on the version of IIS you are using. Consult Microsoft documentation for detailed instructions.
