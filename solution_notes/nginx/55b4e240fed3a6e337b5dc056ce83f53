This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server or inject malicious code into web pages that can be executed by unsuspecting users.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious input.
* Sanitize all user input before using it to generate dynamic SQL statements or HTML code.
* Educate your users about the dangers of injecting unvalidated data into web applications.
