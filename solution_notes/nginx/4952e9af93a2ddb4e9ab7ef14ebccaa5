###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
**How to fix the Web Threats issue of Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens in nginx web server:**

There are two main ways to fix the absence of anti-CSRF tokens in nginx web server:

1. **Use the nginx Lua module.** The nginx Lua module allows you to write Lua code to extend the functionality of nginx. You can use this module to generate and validate CSRF tokens.
2. **Use a third-party module.** There are a number of third-party modules available that can help you to protect your nginx web server from CSRF attacks. One popular option is the nginx-auth-pam module.

**Whichever method you choose, the basic steps involved are as follows:**

1. Generate a unique CSRF token for each user and store it in a session cookie.
2. Include the CSRF token in all POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
3. Validate the CSRF token on the server side before processing the request.

**If the CSRF token is missing or invalid, the request should be rejected.**

**Which OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category does this issue belong to?**

The absence of anti-CSRF tokens belongs to the **A5: Broken Access Control** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021.

**OWASP defines Broken Access Control as follows:**

> **A5: Broken Access Control**

> **Description:** The application does not properly restrict access to functionality or data. This can allow attackers to perform actions as other users, or to access unauthorized data.

> **Impact:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to:

> * Access sensitive data, such as customer records or financial information.
> * Perform actions as other users, such as transferring money or changing account settings.
> * Take control of administrative functions, such as adding or deleting users.

**Examples:**

> * An attacker can exploit a broken access control vulnerability to gain access to a user's account without knowing their password.
> * An attacker can exploit a broken access control vulnerability to upload malicious files to a web server.
> * An attacker can exploit a broken access control vulnerability to delete critical data from a database.

**Recommendations:**

> * Implement strong access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or least privilege.
> * Validate all user input before processing it.
> * Use security frameworks and libraries to help you develop secure applications.

**How to protect your nginx web server from CSRF attacks:**

In addition to using anti-CSRF tokens, there are a number of other things you can do to protect your nginx web server from CSRF attacks:

* Keep your nginx web server and all installed modules up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your nginx web server from common attacks, including CSRF attacks.
* Implement a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded by your web pages.
* Educate your users about CSRF attacks and how to avoid them.

By following these recommendations, you can help to protect your nginx web server from CSRF attacks and other security threats.
