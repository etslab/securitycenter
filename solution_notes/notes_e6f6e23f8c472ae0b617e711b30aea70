**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix the issue, disable the Policy IPsec Extended Mode in the Registry Logon/Logoff settings for the Apache server. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent`
3. Change the value of the "EnableIPsec" registry entry to 0.
4. Restart the Apache server.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The Policy IPsec Extended Mode allows for the use of IPsec encryption during Registry Logon/Logoff operations. This can potentially expose sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, to eavesdroppers on the network.

By disabling this mode, you disable IPsec encryption during Registry Logon/Logoff operations, reducing the risk of sensitive data exposure.

**Additional Tips:**

* Consider implementing other security measures, such as TLS encryption, to further protect sensitive data in transit.
* Regularly review and update your security settings to ensure they are aligned with best practices.
