**Solution:**

**1. Upgrade crypto/x509:**

Update the `crypto/x509` package to the latest version, as it includes fixes for this issue.

**2. Update Apache Configuration:**

Add the following directive to the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf` or `ssl.conf`):

```
SSLVerifyDepth 10
```

This increases the maximum verification depth, allowing certificates with unknown public key algorithms to be verified.

**3. Custom Certificate Verification Function:**

Implement a custom certificate verification function using the `crypto/x509` package's `Certificate.Verify()` method. Override the `LeafCertificate` requirement to accept certificates with unknown algorithms.

```go
func verifyCertificate(cert *x509.Certificate) error {
    if cert.PublicKeyAlgorithm != x509.UnknownPublicKeyAlgorithm {
        return cert.Verify(opts)
    }
    // Handle unknown public key algorithm here
    return nil
}
```

**4. Use a Certificate Authority (CA):**

Obtain a certificate from a trusted CA. CAs use well-known algorithms that are recognized by crypto/x509.
