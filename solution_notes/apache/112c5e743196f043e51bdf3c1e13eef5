**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

The `php:S3626` rule in SonarQube flags potential sensitive data exposure due to the use of the `file_get_contents()` function without filtering or sanitizing the input. This function reads the entire contents of a file into a string, which could potentially expose sensitive data if the file contains such information.

To fix this issue, you should filter and sanitize the input before using `file_get_contents()`. This can be done using techniques such as:

* **Input validation:** Check if the input is from a trusted source and has a valid format.
* **Data sanitization:** Remove or encode potentially harmful characters from the input.
* **Use of a secure library:** Consider using a library that provides secure handling of file contents, such as `fopen()` with the appropriate permissions.

**Example:**

```php
// Unsafe code
$contents = file_get_contents($filename);

// Safe code
if (is_readable($filename) && is_file($filename)) {
    $contents = file_get_contents($filename);
    $contents = htmlspecialchars($contents, ENT_QUOTES);  // Sanitize the contents
}
```

By implementing these measures, you can mitigate the risk of sensitive data exposure.
