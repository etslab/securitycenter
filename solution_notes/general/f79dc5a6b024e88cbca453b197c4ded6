## Severity

**High**

## Detailed Solution

The issue is caused by the fact that deeply nested literals, such as JSON strings or regular expressions, can cause the parser to recurse deeply. This can lead to stack exhaustion, especially in environments with low memory limits.

To fix this issue, you should avoid using deeply nested literals. Instead, you should break them up into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example, you could use multiple JSON strings or regular expressions to represent a complex data structure.
