* Only download dependencies from trusted sources, such as the official package repositories for your language or framework.
* Review the documentation for your dependencies to make sure that you are using them correctly.
* Scan your code regularly for security vulnerabilities using a static code analyzer.
* Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in your code and applications.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your website from App Dependencies issues and other security vulnerabilities.
