**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Enable Audit Policy for Registry Privilege Use:**

   - Open the "Group Policy Editor" (gpedit.msc).
   - Navigate to "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\Audit Policies\System Audit Policies\Object Access."
   - Check the "Object Access" checkbox to enable auditing for registry access.

2. **Audit "Other Privilege Use" Events:**

   - Right-click on "Object Access" and select "Properties."
   - Click the "Advanced Auditing Options" button.
   - In the "Event Type" section, select the "Other Privilege Use" events.

3. **Review Audit Logs:**

   - Monitor the audit logs to identify any suspicious registry access involving "Other Privilege Use" events.
   - Investigate the source of the events and take appropriate action to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Restrict Privileged Access:**

   - Limit the number of users with administrative privileges on the server.
   - Implement least privilege principles by granting only the necessary permissions to users and applications.

5. **Use Registry Hardening Tools:**

   - Consider using registry hardening tools such as Sysinternals' RegAuditor to identify and correct any insecure registry settings.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication** to prevent unauthorized access to privileged accounts.
* **Implement a firewall and intrusion detection system** to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity.
* **Stay up-to-date on Windows security updates** to patch any vulnerabilities that may allow privilege escalation.
* **Perform regular security audits** to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities related to registry access.
