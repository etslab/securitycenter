####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 Files Recently Modified in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 Files Recently Modified in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then

  # Get the list of recently modified files
  files=$(find / -type f -mmin -60)

  # Disable HTTP compression
  sed -i "s/^\(mod_deflate\).*/\1\n\tOptions -compression/" /etc/apache2/mods-available/deflate.conf

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl restart apache2

  # Check if the patch was successful
  if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then
    echo "Patch applied successfully."
  else
    echo "Patch failed to apply."
  fi

else

  echo "Apache is not running."

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get a list of files that have been modified in the last 60 minutes. The script will then disable HTTP compression in the Apache configuration file and restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the patch was successful.

This patch will mitigate the BREACH vulnerability by disabling HTTP compression. HTTP compression can be used by an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive information from a website by sending many targeted requests to the server and trying to figure out the encrypted information byte-by-byte using the pattern in responses. By disabling HTTP compression, this attack vector is no longer available.

It is important to note that this patch is not a complete solution to the BREACH vulnerability. Other mitigations, such as separating secrets from user input and randomizing secrets per request, should also be implemented.
