**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue:** The Policy RunInvalidSignatures in Registry Software->Policies->Microsoft->Internet Explorer->Download registry key is enabled, which allows users to disable ActiveX signing requirements.

**Solution:**

1. Disable the Policy RunInvalidSignatures registry key by setting its value to 0.

2. Use a Group Policy to enforce this setting.

3. Keep antivirus and anti-malware software up to date to protect against unsigned ActiveX controls.

**Impact:**

If an attacker can disable ActiveX signing requirements, they can execute malicious ActiveX controls on the system. This could allow them to gain unauthorized access to the system or sensitive data.
