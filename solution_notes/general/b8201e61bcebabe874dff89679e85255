**Solution:**

1. **Use a supported captcha implementation.** bWAPP uses a custom captcha implementation that is not supported by all browsers. Switch to a widely-supported implementation such as Google reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha.
2. **Add server-side validation.** Relying solely on client-side validation is not sufficient. Implement server-side validation to prevent malicious users from submitting forms without completing the captcha.
3. **Limit retries.** Restrict the number of captcha attempts allowed per user or IP address to prevent brute-force attacks.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The bWAPP-Test:bWAPP/ba_captcha_bypass.php vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the captcha protection by using a custom script that manipulates the DOM. This can lead to account takeover, spam, or other malicious activities.

By implementing the suggested solutions, you can mitigate this vulnerability and enhance the security of your web application.
