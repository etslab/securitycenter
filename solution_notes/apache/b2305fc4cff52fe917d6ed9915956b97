**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Restrict Access to Policy Registry:**
   - Configure Apache's `.htaccess` file to deny access to the Policy Registry directory (e.g., `/registry/policy`).

```htaccess
<Directory "/registry/policy">
  Deny from all
</Directory>
```

2. **Disable Directory Listing:**
   - Add the following directive to `.htaccess` to prevent Apache from listing files in the Policy Registry directory:

```htaccess
Options -Indexes
```

3. **Use Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
   - Set appropriate file and directory permissions using ACLs to restrict access to specific users or groups.
   - For example, use the following command to grant read-only access to the `user1` group:

```
setacl -R -g user1:r /registry/policy
```

4. **Consider Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - Implement a WAF to block malicious requests targeting the Policy Registry.

5. **Regularly Audit and Review:**
   - Regularly review access logs and configurations to ensure the Policy Registry remains secure.
   - Audit the configuration and permissions of the Policy Registry and verify that unauthorized access is restricted.

**Note:** It is important to consider the specific Apache server configuration and deployment environment when implementing these solutions. Consult with a security expert for guidance if necessary.
