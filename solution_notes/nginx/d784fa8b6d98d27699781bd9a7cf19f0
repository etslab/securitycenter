###How to fix the  issue of  in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
The most common issues in Nginx web servers include:

* **Weak configuration** - This is the most common issue, and it can be caused by a number of factors, such as using outdated or insecure configuration settings, or failing to properly secure sensitive files and directories.
* **Outdated software** - Running outdated versions of Nginx or other software components can leave your server vulnerable to known vulnerabilities.
* **Unpatched vulnerabilities** - Even if you are using the latest version of Nginx, it is important to keep it up to date with security patches.
* **Insecure coding practices** - If you are developing your own applications for Nginx, it is important to follow secure coding practices to avoid introducing vulnerabilities.

These issues can lead to a variety of attacks, such as:

* **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** - XSS attacks allow attackers to inject malicious code into your web pages, which can then be executed by other users.
* **SQL injection** - SQL injection attacks allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries on your database, which can lead to data theft or destruction.
* **Remote code execution (RCE)** - RCE attacks allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your server, which can give them full control of your system.
* **Denial-of-service (DoS)** - DoS attacks can overwhelm your server with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

To fix these issues, you should:

* **Review your Nginx configuration** and make sure that it is secure. You can find documentation on how to do this on the Nginx website.
* **Keep your Nginx software up to date** with the latest security patches.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF)** to protect your web applications from common attacks.
* **Follow secure coding practices** when developing your own applications for Nginx.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that these issues belong to is **A1: Broken Access Control**. This category encompasses vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to resources on your web server or web application.

Here are some specific examples of Nginx vulnerabilities that fall under the A1 category:

* **Directory traversal vulnerabilities** - These vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files and directories that they should not be able to access.
* **Insecure file permissions** - These vulnerabilities allow attackers to read, write, or execute files that they should not be able to access.
* **Weak session management** - These vulnerabilities allow attackers to steal or hijack user sessions, which can give them access to the user's account and data.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should follow the recommendations above and also:

* **Implement strong access control mechanisms** to ensure that users can only access the resources that they are authorized to access.
* **Use secure file permissions** to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive files and directories.
* **Implement strong session management mechanisms** to prevent attackers from stealing or hijacking user sessions.

You can also use a vulnerability scanner to scan your Nginx web server for known vulnerabilities.
