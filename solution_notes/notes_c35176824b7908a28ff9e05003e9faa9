**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:**

The onetrust-integration in the Apache server can be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This occurs when the application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact:**

An XSS attack can allow an attacker to:

* Steal user credentials
* Hijack user sessions
* Redirect users to malicious websites
* Deface the website

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, implement the following recommended actions:

1. **Sanitize all user input:** Use appropriate input validation techniques to ensure that user input does not contain malicious script code. This can be done using HTML encoding or other appropriate mechanisms.
2. **Use a secure HTTP header:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header to restrict the execution of scripts from untrusted sources. This can be done by adding the following header to your Apache configuration:

```
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self';"
```

3. **Update the onetrust-integration component:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of the onetrust-integration component, which may have addressed this vulnerability.

**Additional Mitigation:**

In addition to the recommended actions above, consider the following:

* **Limit user privileges:** Restrict the permissions granted to users to reduce the potential impact of an XSS attack.
* **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious traffic, including XSS attacks.
* **Monitor the application for suspicious activity:** Regularly review logs and monitor the application for any signs of unauthorized script execution.
