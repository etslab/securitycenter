**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A10:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Update the APK to use a secure implementation of the library with no exposed sensitive information.
2. Remove or obfuscate any sensitive information embedded within the library.
3. Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious input from reaching the library.
4. Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to the library to authorized users only.
5. Consider using a security scanner to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

* The presence of the shared library file libapminsighta.so in the apache server's APK output directory suggests that sensitive performance monitoring data may be exposed to unauthorized access.
* Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of sensitive data, such as user credentials, transaction details, or other confidential information.
* It is crucial to address this issue promptly to prevent potential data breaches and maintain the security of the application.
