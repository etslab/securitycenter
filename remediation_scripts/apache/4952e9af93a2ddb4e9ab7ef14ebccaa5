Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status >/dev/null 2>&1
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Apache is running, stop it
    service apache2 stop
  fi
fi

# Install the mod_security2 module
a2enmod mod_security2

# Configure mod_security2 to protect against CSRF attacks
cp /etc/modsecurity2/modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf /etc/modsecurity2/modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf.orig
sed -i 's/#IncludeOptional modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf/Include modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf/g' /etc/modsecurity2/modsecurity_config.conf

# Restart Apache
service apache2 start


This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, it will stop Apache. Next, the script will install the mod_security2 module. This module provides a number of security features, including protection against CSRF attacks. Finally, the script will configure mod_security2 to protect against CSRF attacks.

After the patch script has been run, Apache will be restarted. This will ensure that the new security features are enabled.

It is important to note that this is just one example of a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2013-0169. There may be other patch scripts available that are more specific to your environment. If you are unsure of how to remediate this vulnerability, you should consult with a security professional.
