**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Solution:**

To fix the issue, you need to update your Apache server to version 2.4.15 or later, or disable the vulnerable module (mod_dav_fs).

**Steps to update Apache server:**

1. Stop the Apache server.
2. Download the latest Apache server version from the official website.
3. Unpack the tarball and copy the files to your server's software directory.
4. Configure Apache as necessary.
5. Start the Apache server.

**Steps to disable mod_dav_fs:**

1. Edit the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf).
2. Find the line that loads the mod_dav_fs module and comment it out. The line will typically look like this:
```
LoadModule dav_fs_module modules/mod_dav_fs.so
```
3. Restart the Apache server.

**Additional Notes:**

* If you are unable to update or disable the vulnerable module, you can implement a workaround by setting the LimitRequestBody directive in your Apache configuration file to a low value (e.g., 100 bytes). This will prevent attackers from sending large requests that could trigger the vulnerability.
* You should also review your Apache configuration to ensure that the mod_dav_fs module is not being used in any other way that could pose a security risk.
