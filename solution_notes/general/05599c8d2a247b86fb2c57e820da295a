**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server Misconfiguration

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Affected Registry Key:**
   ```
   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WcmSvc\wifinetworkmanager\config
   ```

2. **Edit the Registry Key:**
   - Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to the identified registry key.
   - Create or modify the following DWORD value:
     - Name: PolicyAutoConnectAllowedOEM
     - Value: 0

3. **Restart the WCM Service:**
   - Type "services.msc" in the Run dialog box.
   - Find and stop the "WCM Service" (Windows Connection Manager).
   - Start the service again.

**Impact:**

Enabling the PolicyAutoConnectAllowedOEM registry key allows Windows to automatically connect to open Wi-Fi networks offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This can be a security risk as malicious actors might create rogue networks to intercept sensitive data from unsuspecting users.

**Assessment:**

This issue is rated as "Medium" severity because it involves a potential threat to data confidentiality. If an attacker gains access to the system and modifies the registry key, they could potentially connect to a malicious Wi-Fi network and compromise the user's data. However, the issue can be easily mitigated by disabling the automatic connection feature.
