####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Server Leaks Information via X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field(s) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Server Leaks Information via X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field(s) in Apache HTTP Server:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

    # Check if the X-Powered-By header is enabled
    grep -q "X-Powered-By" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then

      # Disable the X-Powered-By header
      sed -i -e 's/X-Powered-By/#X-Powered-By/' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

      # Restart Apache
      service apache2 restart

      echo "Successfully patched CVE-2013-0169."
    else
      echo "The X-Powered-By header is not enabled. No action required."
    fi
  else
    echo "Apache is not running. No action required."
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not installed. No action required."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then check if the X-Powered-By header is enabled. If it is, the script will disable the header and restart Apache. If the header is not enabled, the script will not take any action.
