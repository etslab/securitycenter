**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Enable Logging:**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System`.
* Double-click on the "Enabled" value and set it to 1.

**2. Configure Event ID Filtering:**

* In the Registry Editor, navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System\Policies`.
* Right-click and create a new DWORD value named "EventID".
* Set the value of "EventID" to 4690 (corresponding to Policy Other System Events).

**3. Verify Event Logging:**

* Open the Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc).
* Expand "Windows Logs" and select "System".
* Check if Event ID 4690 is being logged.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Enable auditing for Policy Other System Events:** This will allow you to track attempts to perform registry modifications.
* **Review logged events regularly:** Identify suspicious activity and investigate accordingly.
* **Use a security information and event management (SIEM) system:** This can help you correlate events from multiple sources and detect threats.
