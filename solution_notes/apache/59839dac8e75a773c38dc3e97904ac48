**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Path Traversal

**Solution:**

The issue arises due to a path traversal vulnerability in the OneSignalExtension.framework component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to files or directories on the server.

To fix the issue, you need to update the OneSignalExtension framework to the latest version. The latest version includes a fix for the path traversal vulnerability.

Here are the steps to update the framework:

1. Download the latest version of the OneSignalExtension framework from the OneSignal website.
2. Replace the existing OneSignalExtension.framework file with the downloaded file.
3. Restart the Apache server.

After updating the framework, the path traversal vulnerability will be fixed.

**Additional Notes:**

You should also review your code to make sure that there are no other path traversal vulnerabilities. You can use a static code analyzer to help you find potential vulnerabilities.

It is important to keep all software up-to-date to avoid security vulnerabilities. You should have a regular update schedule in place to ensure that all software is updated regularly.
