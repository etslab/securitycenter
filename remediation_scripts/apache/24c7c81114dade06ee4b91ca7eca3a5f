####patch script to remediate  cert subjectAltName, No SAN browsers are complaining in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate the cert subjectAltName issue in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the Apache HTTP Server is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current certificate
  cert=$(cat /etc/ssl/certs/apache.pem)

  # Check if the certificate has a subjectAltName extension
  if ! grep -q "subjectAltName" <<< "$cert"; then

    # Add a subjectAltName extension to the certificate
    echo "subjectAltName=DNS:*" >> /etc/ssl/certs/apache.pem

    # Restart Apache HTTP Server
    systemctl restart httpd
  fi
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache HTTP Server is running. If it is, the script will get the current certificate and check if it has a subjectAltName extension. If it does not, the script will add a subjectAltName extension to the certificate and restart Apache HTTP Server.

This should resolve the issue of No SAN browsers complaining in Apache HTTP Server.

Here are some additional notes about the script:

* The script uses the `pgrep` command to check if Apache HTTP Server is running.
* The script uses the `grep` command to check if the certificate has a subjectAltName extension.
* The script uses the `echo` command to add a subjectAltName extension to the certificate.
* The script uses the `systemctl` command to restart Apache HTTP Server.

I hope this helps!
