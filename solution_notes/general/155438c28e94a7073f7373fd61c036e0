**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A5 - Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Edit the Registry:**
   - Navigate to the registry key: `SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MrxSmb10`
   - Double-click on the "Start" DWORD value
   - Set the value data to `4` (Disabled)

2. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart the Apache server to apply the changes made to the registry.

**Impact:**

Leaving SMBv1 (Server Message Block version 1) enabled allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in this protocol, leading to potential data breaches, remote code execution, and other security risks. Disabling SMBv1 increases the security of the Apache server by removing a common attack vector.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is recommended to disable SMBv1 globally on all systems within the network to mitigate potential risks.
* If disabling SMBv1 is not immediately feasible due to legacy application dependencies, implement additional security measures such as restricting access to the SMBv1 port (445/TCP) and using strong passwords.
