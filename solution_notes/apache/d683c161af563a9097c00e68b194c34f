###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2017-15906
CVE-2017-15906 is a vulnerability in the Apache web server that allows an attacker to create zero-length files. This can be exploited to cause a denial of service or to inject malicious code into the web server.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache web server to a version that is not affected. You can find the latest version of Apache at the Apache Software Foundation website.

CVE-2017-15906 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Security Risks 2021 category of **Injection**. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Sanitize all user input before sending it to the browser to avoid XSS attacks.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to help block common injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help protect your web server from injection attacks.
