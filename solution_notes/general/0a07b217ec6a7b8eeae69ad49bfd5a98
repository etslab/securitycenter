CVE-2016-2183 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risk category of **Injection**. Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. In the case of CVE-2016-2183, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary code into the nginx configuration file, which would then be executed by the nginx process.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection flaws:

* Use a parameterized query language (SQL, JPA, etc.) to execute all database queries. This will prevent attackers from injecting SQL code into your queries.
* Validate all user input before using it in any commands or queries. This will help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into your application.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your application from common web attacks, including injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your application from injection flaws and other common web attacks.
