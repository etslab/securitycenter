**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:**

Policy NC_ShowSharedAccessUI in Registry Software->Policies->Microsoft->Windows->Network Connections allows users to enable or disable the Shared Access UI in Network Connections. If this policy is set to "0", it disables the Shared Access UI, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access to shared network resources. However, if this policy is set to "1", it enables the Shared Access UI, which could lead to the exposure of sensitive data such as network credentials and permissions.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue and mitigate the risk of sensitive data exposure, set Policy NC_ShowSharedAccessUI to "0" in Registry Software->Policies->Microsoft->Windows->Network Connections.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections
    ```
3. Create a new DWORD value named "NC_ShowSharedAccessUI".
4. Set the value data to "0" (disable Shared Access UI).

**Verification:**

To verify that the fix was successful, follow these steps:

1. Open Network Connections (ncpa.cpl).
2. Right-click on a network connection and select "Properties".
3. Click on the "Sharing" tab.
4. Ensure that the "Enable network sharing" checkbox is unchecked.

**Additional Notes:**

* This policy setting only applies to Windows operating systems.
* It is recommended to regularly review and assess registry settings to ensure that they are appropriately configured to protect against data exposure and other vulnerabilities.
