**Issue:**

Enabled the Policy LogSuccessfulConnections may log successful connections to the server, which could potentially disclose sensitive information to unauthorized users.

**Solution:**

To disable logging of successful connections, set the following registry key to 0:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging\LogSuccessfulConnections
```

**Steps:**

1. Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type "regedit" and press Enter.
3. Navigate to the registry key mentioned above.
4. Right-click on "LogSuccessfulConnections" and select "Modify".
5. Change the Value data to 0.
6. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Information:**

* This registry setting is only applicable to the Public Profile firewall profile.
* Disabling this setting may reduce the visibility of potential security breaches, but it also reduces the amount of information available for troubleshooting and analysis.
* Consider using other security measures, such as implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF), to protect the server from unauthorized access.
