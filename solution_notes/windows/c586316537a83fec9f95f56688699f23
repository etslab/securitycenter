**Solution:**

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters
   ```
3. Locate the "NoNameReleaseOnDemand" registry value.
4. Double-click the "NoNameReleaseOnDemand" registry value and change the Value data to "1".
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.
6. Restart the apache server.

**Explanation:**

The "NoNameReleaseOnDemand" registry value determines whether name release on demand is disabled or enabled. When name release on demand is enabled, a remote attacker can send a specially crafted packet to the server that will cause the server to release the NetBIOS name of the victim computer. This information can be used by the attacker to identify the victim computer and launch further attacks.

By disabling name release on demand, you can prevent this type of attack from being successful.
