####patch script to remediate  Does not redirect to an HTTPS site in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate the issue of Apache HTTP Server not redirecting to an HTTPS site:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current Apache configuration
  config=$(cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf)

  # Add the following line to the configuration to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
  echo "RewriteEngine On" >> $config
  echo "RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on" >> $config
  echo "RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]" >> $config

  # Restart Apache
  service httpd restart

else

  echo "Apache is not running."

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current Apache configuration and add the following line to it:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^/?(.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
```

This line will redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

Once the script has finished running, all HTTP traffic to your Apache server will be redirected to HTTPS. This will improve the security of your website by preventing users from accessing it over HTTP, which is a less secure protocol.
