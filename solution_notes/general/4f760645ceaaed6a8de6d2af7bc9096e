**Description:**
The go/parser package in Go processes source code and builds a parse tree. However, in certain scenarios, the parser can enter an infinite loop, leading to a server crash or resource exhaustion.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Upgrade Go:** Update to the latest version of Go (1.19.2 or higher as of this writing) to benefit from the bug fixes provided in recent releases.
2. **Review Code:** Inspect your codebase for any of the following constructs that may trigger the infinite loop:
    - `for` loops with range expressions over channel types (`for i := range c {}`)
    - `select` statements with cases that can block indefinitely
3. **Use Go Modules:** If you are not already using Go modules, adopt them to manage your dependencies and track version changes.

**Detailed Solution for Specific Scenarios:**

**1. Channel Range Expressions:**
If you have `for` loops iterating over channels, ensure that the channels are properly closed when they are no longer needed. For example:

```go
func main() {
    c := make(chan int)
    go func() {
        c <- 42
        close(c)
    }()
    for i := range c {
        fmt.Println(i)  // Now it will exit when c is closed
    }
}
```

**2. Blocking `select` Cases:**
If you have a `select` statement with cases that can block indefinitely, introduce timeouts or other mechanisms to prevent the server from hanging. For example:

```go
func main() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second)
    c := make(chan int)
    for {
        select {
        case i := <-c:
            fmt.Println(i)
        case <-ticker.C:
            fmt.Println("Timeout occurred")
        }
    }
}
```

**3. Unbounded Loops:**
If you have loops with unbounded or indefinite conditions, consider introducing appropriate exit conditions or using timeouts to prevent the server from hanging.
