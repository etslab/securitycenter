**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to disable RSA key exchanges in TLS. You can do this by adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:

```
SSLProtocol -all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1
```

This will disable all SSL and TLS protocols except for TLSv1.2 and higher, which are not vulnerable to this attack.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* To mitigate this issue further, you should consider using forward secrecy by disabling non-ephemeral RSA key exchanges.
* You should also consider using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for key exchange, as it is not vulnerable to this attack.

**Additional Information:**

This issue is a result of a timing side channel attack that can be used to extract the private key from an RSA server. The attack works by measuring the time it takes for the server to perform certain operations, and then using this information to deduce the private key.

This issue is considered high severity because it can lead to the compromise of sensitive data, such as user passwords and credit card numbers.
