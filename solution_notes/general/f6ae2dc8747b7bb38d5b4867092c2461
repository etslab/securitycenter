**Issue Description:**

The net/netip package in Go incorrectly handles IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses when using the `Is` methods (`IsGlobalUnicast`, `IsPrivate`, etc.). Specifically, the library doesn't treat these addresses as IPv4 addresses, leading to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on this functionality.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can upgrade to Go version 1.18 or later, which includes a fix for this problem. Alternatively, you can manually handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses as IPv4 addresses in your application code.

**Detailed Steps to Fix the Issue:**

1. Upgrade to Go 1.18 or later.
2. If you can't upgrade, handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses explicitly in your code. For example:

```go
import (
    "net"
    "net/netip"
)

func CheckIPv4MappedIPv6(addr string) {
    ip := net.ParseIP(addr)
    if ip == nil {
        return // Invalid IP address
    }

    if ip.To4() != nil {
        // Handle as IPv4 address
    } else {
        // Handle as IPv6 address
    }
}
```

**Impact:**

This issue can lead to incorrect behavior in applications that rely on the `Is` methods to determine the type of an IP address. For example, an application might mistakenly classify an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address as a private address, which could lead to security issues.
