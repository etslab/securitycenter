**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can protect the service by adding the `android:exported` attribute with the value "false" in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<service
    android:name=".PlayerService"
    android:exported="false"
    >
    ...
</service>
```

This will prevent external applications from directly accessing the service.

**Explanation:**

Exposing services to external applications (by setting `android:exported` to "true") can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data or the execution of malicious code. By protecting the service, you mitigate this risk and enhance the security of your app.
