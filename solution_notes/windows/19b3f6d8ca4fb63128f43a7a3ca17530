**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Disable the Registry LogonLogoff Policy:**

   - Open Registry Editor (regedit) and navigate to:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
     ```
   - Change the value of "LogonLogoff" to "0" (DWORD).

2. **Set Audit Policy to Track Logon/Logoff Events:**

   - Open Local Security Policy Editor (secpol.msc).
   - Under "Local Policies", go to "Audit Policy".
   - Enable auditing for "Logon/Logoff" events (Success and Failure).

3. **Review Audit Logs Regularly:**

   - Monitor audit logs to detect any suspicious logon/logoff attempts.
   - Investigate and respond to any unauthorized access attempts promptly.

**Explanation:**

The Registry LogonLogoff Policy allows users to log on and log off without prompting for a password or issuing a logon/logoff event. This can potentially allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system or evade detection. By disabling this policy and enabling auditing, you can mitigate this risk.
