**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Check the Certificate Expiry Date:** Verify the accuracy of the cert notAfter date. If it is indeed nearing expiration, you need to update the certificate.
2. **Update the Certificate:** Obtain a new SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority (CA) and install it on your Apache server.
3. **Configure Apache Server:** Update your Apache configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf) to use the new certificate.
4. **Restart Apache Server:** Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.
5. **Verify the Updated Certificate:** Access your website using a secure protocol (e.g., HTTPS) and check if the certificate is valid and not expired.

**Detailed Explanation:**

An expired SSL certificate can lead to several security risks:

* **Interception of Sensitive Data:** If the certificate expires, the connection between the client and server becomes unencrypted, exposing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) to eavesdropping.
* **Website Accessibility Issues:** Browsers and operating systems typically display warnings or block access to websites with expired certificates, affecting the user experience and website availability.
* **Loss of Trust:** Expired certificates indicate poor website maintenance and can damage user trust in the organization.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a certificate management tool to automate certificate renewal and prevent future expirations.
* Set up email alerts to notify you when a certificate is approaching its expiration date.
* Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to monitor and block malicious traffic.
