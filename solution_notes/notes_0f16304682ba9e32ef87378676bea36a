**Severity:** High

**Issue Description:**

The Policy CachedLogonsCount value controls the number of cached logon operations that are performed per interactive logon session. A high value for this registry setting can allow an attacker to brute force user credentials by attempting multiple logon attempts without being locked out.

**Solution:**

Set the Policy CachedLogonsCount value to a low number, such as 5 or 10. This will limit the number of logon attempts that can be made per session and reduce the risk of brute force attacks.

To set the registry value:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
```
3. Double-click on the "Policy CachedLogonsCount" value.
4. Enter a low number in the "Value data" field, such as 5 or 10.
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to note that a low value for Policy CachedLogonsCount can impact the performance of interactive logons.
* If you experience any performance issues, you may need to increase the value of this registry setting.
* You should also consider implementing additional security measures, such as account lockouts and two-factor authentication, to further protect against brute force attacks.
