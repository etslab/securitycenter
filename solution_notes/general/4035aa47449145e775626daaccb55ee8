**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Update Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.56 or higher.**
    - For Debian-based systems: `apt-get update && apt-get install apache2`
    - For Red Hat-based systems: `yum update httpd`
2. **Restart Apache HTTP Server.**
    - For Debian-based systems: `/etc/init.d/apache2 restart`
    - For Red Hat-based systems: `systemctl restart httpd`

**Additional Mitigation:**

* **Review Apache HTTP Server configuration** to ensure that the `AllowOverride` directive is set to "None" for all sensitive directories.
* **Disable unnecessary modules** to reduce the attack surface.
* **Implement a web application firewall (WAF)** to block malicious requests.
