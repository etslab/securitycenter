**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor by typing "regedit" in the Run dialog box (Windows key + R).
2. Navigate to the following key:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging
    ```

3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named "LogFileSize" if it does not already exist.
4. Double-click on the "LogFileSize" value and set its value data to 51200 (50 MB).
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Explanation:**

The Registry value "Policy LogFileSize" specifies the maximum size of the Windows Firewall private profile log file. If the log file exceeds this size, it will be truncated. A value of 51200 (50 MB) is recommended to ensure that logs are retained for a reasonable amount of time.

Insufficient logging can make it difficult to detect and investigate security incidents. By ensuring that the Windows Firewall log file is of an appropriate size, you can improve the security of your system.
