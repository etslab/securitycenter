**Severity:** Medium

**Solution:**

Uncomment the code that checks for the CAPTCHA response.

```php
if (!isset($_POST['captcha']) || $_POST['captcha'] != $_SESSION['last_captcha']) {
    die('Invalid captcha');
}
```

**Explanation:**

The commented-out code prevents the application from checking the CAPTCHA response, allowing an attacker to bypass the CAPTCHA protection and potentially access unauthorized data. By uncommenting this code, the application will correctly validate the CAPTCHA response and prevent unauthorized access.
