####patch script to remediate  TLS1 1, offered (deprecated) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate TLS 1.1, offered (deprecated) in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current configuration file
  config_file="/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"

  # Check if TLS 1.1 is enabled
  if grep -q "TLSv1.1" "$config_file"; then

    # Disable TLS 1.1
    sed -i "s/TLSv1.1/TLSv1.2/g" "$config_file"

    # Restart Apache
    systemctl restart apache2

    echo "TLS 1.1 has been disabled."
  else
    echo "TLS 1.1 is not enabled."
  fi

else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current configuration file and check if TLS 1.1 is enabled. If it is, the script will disable TLS 1.1 and restart Apache. If TLS 1.1 is not enabled, the script will simply print a message stating that it is not enabled.

Please note that this is just a sample script and may need to be modified to work with your specific Apache configuration.
