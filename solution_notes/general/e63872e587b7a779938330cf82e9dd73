**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use shorter RSA keys:** Replace the large RSA keys with smaller ones, such as 2048 bits or less.
2. **Enable TLS 1.3:** TLS 1.3 uses more efficient algorithms for certificate chain verification. Enabling TLS 1.3 can significantly improve verification performance.
3. **Configure TLS session caching:** TLS session caching can store verified certificate chains in memory, reducing the need for repeated verification. Enable session caching in your Apache configuration.
4. **Use a hardware security module (HSM):** An HSM is a dedicated device designed to perform cryptographic operations efficiently. Offloading certificate verification to an HSM can improve performance.
5. **Optimize the verification process:** Use optimized libraries or techniques for certificate verification. For example, you can use the "crypto/x509" package in Go, which provides optimizations for certificate chain verification.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that the certificates used are valid and trusted.
* Perform regular security audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.
* Monitor the Apache server for any unusual activity or performance issues.
