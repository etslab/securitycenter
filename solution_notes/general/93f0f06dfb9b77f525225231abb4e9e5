**Severity:** Medium to High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description:**

The "Policy MSAOptional" registry key is enabled, which allows users to bypass the Windows security policy that prevents unauthenticated users from modifying the session identifier (SID) of a system. This can lead to privilege escalation and other security vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
   ```
3. Double-click the "Policy MSAOptional" registry key.
4. Change the "Value data" to "0".
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.
6. Reboot the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The default value of "Policy MSAOptional" is "1", which enables the bypass.
* Disabling "Policy MSAOptional" does not affect the ability of authenticated users to modify the SID.
* It is recommended to keep "Policy MSAOptional" disabled for maximum security.
