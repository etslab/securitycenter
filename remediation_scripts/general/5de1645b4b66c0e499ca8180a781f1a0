####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-0196 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-0196 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache HTTP Server is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/httpd ]; then
  echo "Apache HTTP Server is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check the version of Apache HTTP Server
version=$(/usr/sbin/httpd -V | awk '{print $2}')

# If the version is vulnerable, patch it
if [[ "$version" -lt 2.4.39 ]]; then
  echo "Apache HTTP Server is vulnerable to CVE-2019-0196. Patching..."
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz
  tar -xf httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz
  cd httpd-2.4.39
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make
  make install
  echo "Patching complete."
else
  echo "Apache HTTP Server is not vulnerable to CVE-2019-0196."
fi
```

This script will check if Apache HTTP Server is installed and the version. If the version is vulnerable, it will download the latest patched version of Apache HTTP Server and install it.
