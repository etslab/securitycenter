**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Audit Policy:** Enable the "Audit Policy" setting to log all Registry key access attempts. This can be done through the "Local Security Policy" tool (secpol.msc). Navigate to "Security Settings" > "Audit Policies" > "Object Access" and enable "Audit registry" setting.

2. **Configure Rule Audit Policies:** Create a new rule in the "Audit Policy" tool to specifically log all registry key access attempts that are related to privileged Registry keys. You can use the following query:

   ```
   (ProcessName="regedit" OR ProcessName="regasm" OR ProcessName="reg" OR ProcessName="regedt32" OR ObjectName="SYSTEM\\*")
   ```

3. **Use Desired State Configuration (DSC) Policy:** Implement a DSC policy to enforce desired Registry key permissions, ensuring that only authorized users have access to privileged Registry keys. This can be achieved by setting the "Owner" and "Permissions" properties of the Registry key in the DSC configuration script.

4. **Monitor Registry Access Logs:** Regularly review the Registry access logs generated by the Audit Policy to identify any suspicious or unauthorized attempts to access privileged Registry keys. Investigate any irregularities and take appropriate action.

5. **Consider Alternative Ways to Configure Settings:** Explore alternative methods to configure settings that do not require Registry key access, such as using Group Policy or WMI. This can help reduce the risk of unauthorized access to privileged Registry keys.
