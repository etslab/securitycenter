**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Weak Authentication

**Issue Explanation:**

The Policy LimitBlankPasswordUse registry value controls whether users are allowed to set blank passwords. When this value is set to 0, users are allowed to set blank passwords, which is a significant security risk. Blank passwords are easy to guess and can be used to compromise accounts.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`
3. Right-click on the **LimitBlankPasswordUse** value and select **Modify**.
4. In the Value data field, enter **1** and click **OK**.

This will set the LimitBlankPasswordUse value to 1, which will prevent users from setting blank passwords.

**Note:** This solution will only apply to future password changes. Any existing blank passwords will still need to be changed manually.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Enforce strong password policies that require a minimum password length, complexity, and regular expiration.
* Use two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security to user accounts.
* Regularly review and audit user accounts to detect and address any weak passwords.
