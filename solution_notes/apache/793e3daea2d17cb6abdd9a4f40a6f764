**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Disable the Admin Account:** Remove the "Admin" user account or change the default account name.
2. **Set Strong Password:** If the Admin account exists, set a strong and unique password.
3. **Disable Registry Access for Admin Account:** Remove the "Modify" and "Write" permissions for the Admin account in the following registry keys:
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
4. **Configure Windows Firewall:** Block access to the registry ports (TCP 135, 137-139, and UDP 137-138) from untrusted networks.
5. **Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Configure your WAF to block requests that attempt to modify registry settings.
6. **Use Least Privilege:** Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for users to perform their tasks.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly monitor the registry for unauthorized changes.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block suspicious activity.
* Train users on best practices for secure configuration and access control.
