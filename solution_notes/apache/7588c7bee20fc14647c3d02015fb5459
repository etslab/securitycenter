**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Add `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` to `info.plist`:**

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Provide a clear and concise description of why your app needs location access.</string>
```

2. **Update `Info.plist` using Xcode:**

* Open the project in Xcode.
* Select the project in the project navigator.
* Click the "Info" tab in the project editor.
* Under "Property List", expand "App Transport Security Settings".
* Add a new key called "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" and set its value to the desired description.

**Additional Notes:**

* The description should explain to users why the app needs location access and how the data will be used.
* If the app does not need location access when it is not in use, ensure that the `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` key is not included in `info.plist`.
* Failure to provide an accurate and understandable description can lead to user mistrust and decreased app usage.
