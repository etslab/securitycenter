###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
To fix the Web Threats issue of Missing Anti-clickjacking Header in apache web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Apache configuration file. This file is usually located in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
2. Find the section that defines the `<VirtualHost>` for your website.
3. Add the following line to the `<VirtualHost>` section:

```
Header always set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
```

4. Save the configuration file and restart Apache.

This will add the `X-Frame-Options` header to all responses from your website. This header tells browsers not to allow your website to be displayed in a frame or iframe. This helps to prevent clickjacking attacks.

The Missing Anti-clickjacking Header issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category A3: Cross-site Scripting (XSS). XSS is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page. This code can then be executed by the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.

By adding the `X-Frame-Options` header to your website, you can help to prevent clickjacking attacks, which are a type of XSS attack. Clickjacking attacks allow an attacker to trick a victim into clicking on a malicious link or button without their knowledge. This can be used to steal personal information, install malware, or redirect the victim to a malicious website.

By following the steps above, you can help to secure your website from clickjacking attacks and other XSS attacks.
