**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Issue:**
SMB1 is an insecure file-sharing protocol that allows access to sensitive data on the server. By exploiting a vulnerability in SMB1, attackers can execute arbitrary code remotely, leading to a complete compromise of the server.

**Solution:**
Disable SMB1 on the server using the following steps:

1. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
2. Navigate to `SYSTEM->CurrentControlSet->Services->LanmanServer->Parameters`
3. Locate the `SMB1` key and set its value to `0`

**Additional Mitigation:**
* Keep the server and software up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a firewall to restrict access to the server to only authorized sources.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor for suspicious activity.

**Impact:**
The exploitation of SMB1 can lead to:

* Remote code execution on the server
* Denial of service attacks
* Data theft
* Malware distribution

**Recommendation:**
It is highly recommended to disable SMB1 immediately to mitigate the risk of a security breach.
