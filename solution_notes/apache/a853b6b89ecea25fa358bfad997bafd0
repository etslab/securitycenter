**Solution:**

The CBC padding oracle attack is a cryptographic vulnerability that can allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted data. This vulnerability is caused by an implementation flaw in the server's encryption code that allows an attacker to use a padding oracle to determine whether a given padding string is valid.

To fix this issue, you need to disable CBC padding in your Apache server. You can do this by adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:

```
SSLCipherSuite !aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:RSA+3DES:RSA+CHACHA20-POLY1305:!DHE
```

This line will disable CBC ciphers and force Apache to use more secure cipher suites.

You should also check your server's logs to see if there is any evidence of an attack. If you find any evidence of an attack, you should take steps to mitigate the damage, such as rotating your encryption keys and notifying your users.
