###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2013-0169 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
CVE-2013-0169 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the nginx web server. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the server. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the nginx user.

To fix the CVE-2013-0169 vulnerability, you should upgrade to nginx version 1.4.8 or later. If you cannot upgrade, you can apply the following workaround:


add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';" always;


This will prevent the server from executing any scripts or loading any stylesheets from other domains.

CVE-2013-0169 belongs to the **Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021. This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. This code can then be executed by the application, giving the attacker control over the application.

Here are some additional recommendations for protecting against CVE-2013-0169:

* Keep your nginx software up to date.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
* Implement input validation to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into your application.
* Use a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the types of resources that can be loaded by your application.

If you are using a managed nginx service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing, the service provider will typically patch vulnerabilities for you. However, it is always a good idea to check with your provider to make sure that the latest security patches have been installed.
