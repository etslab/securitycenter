**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Injection

**Solution:**

1. **Disable Registry Logon/Logoff:** This feature is not recommended for use in production environments, as it allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Disable it by setting the following directive in your Apache configuration file:

```
LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
```

2. **Enforce Authentication:** If you need to use Registry Logon/Logoff, ensure that users can only authenticate using a strong password or other secure mechanism.

3. **Restrict Access to Registry Files:** Limit access to the registry files only to authorized users.

4. **Use a Safe Output Encoding Library:** When displaying user-supplied data, use a safe output encoding library to prevent injection attacks.

5. **Validate User Input:** Validate all user input before using it in any operation. This includes validating the format, type, and length of the input.

6. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic before it reaches your application.

7. **Regularly Patch Your Server:** Keep your Apache server and any underlying software up-to-date with the latest security patches to fix known vulnerabilities.
