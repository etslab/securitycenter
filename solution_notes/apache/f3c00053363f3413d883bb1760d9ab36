**Severity:** Critical

**Description:** This vulnerability allows unprivileged users to escape from a chroot environment in Apache server, potentially gaining access to the rest of the system.

**Impact:**

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data
* Execution of arbitrary commands
* Compromise of the entire system

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A5 - Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

Update coreutils to version 8.32 or later. This update includes a patch that fixes the vulnerability by changing the way chroot handles environment variables.

**Steps to apply the fix:**

1. Check if your system is affected by running the following command:

```
rpm -qa | grep coreutils
```

2. If coreutils version is less than 8.32, update it using your package manager:

```
yum update coreutils
```

3. Restart Apache server to apply the changes:

```
systemctl restart httpd
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability is also known as "chroot escape" or "coreutils chroot escape".
* It is important to apply the fix promptly to prevent attackers from exploiting this vulnerability.
* For systems that cannot be immediately updated, it is recommended to disable chroot in Apache server until the update can be applied.
