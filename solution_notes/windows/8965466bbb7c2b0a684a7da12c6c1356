**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2: Broken Access Control

**Impact:**

The Policy Option:AuditBaseObjects in Registry Option - AuditBaseObjects setting allows an attacker to gain access to and modify critical system files and configurations, potentially compromising the integrity and security of the server.

**Solution:**

To mitigate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```
3. Create or modify the DWORD value named "AuditBaseObjects" and set its value to 1.
4. Restart the server to apply the changes.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* Implement strong access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive files and resources.
* Regularly monitor the security logs for suspicious activity.
* Use a firewall to block unauthorized access to the server from outside networks.
* Keep the server software up to date with the latest security patches.
