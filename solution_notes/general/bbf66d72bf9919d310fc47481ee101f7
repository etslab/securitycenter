**Severity**: Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category**: Broken Access Control

**Solution**:

The issue is that the code is using the `$_GET` variable directly without proper validation. This can be exploited by an attacker to bypass the captcha by crafting a specially crafted URL.

To fix this issue, you can use the following code:

```php
if (isset($_GET['captcha']) && $_GET['captcha'] == '123') {
    // ...
}
```

This code will only allow the captcha to be bypassed if the `$_GET['captcha']` variable is equal to '123'.

**Additional Notes**:

* This issue has been identified by SonarQube as a potential security vulnerability.
* It is important to note that the severity of this issue may vary depending on the context in which it is used.
* It is always a good practice to validate user input before using it in your code.
