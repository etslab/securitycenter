**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The Policy AllowCustomSSPsAPs registry value controls whether applications can create their own security providers. If this value is set to 1, applications can bypass system-wide security policies and create their own, potentially insecure security providers.

**Impact:**

An attacker could exploit this issue to create custom security providers that allow them to bypass system-wide security policies. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform other malicious actions.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the AllowCustomSSPsAPs registry value to 0. This will prevent applications from creating their own security providers and force them to use the system-wide security policies.

**To set the registry value:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System
   ```
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named AllowCustomSSPsAPs.
4. Set the value data to 0.
5. Click OK.

**Note:** You may need to restart the computer for the changes to take effect.
