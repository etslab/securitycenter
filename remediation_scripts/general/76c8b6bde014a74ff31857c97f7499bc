####patch script to remediate  Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate the Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set in Apache HTTP Server:


#! /bin/bash

# Check if the CSP header is set
if ! grep -q "Content-Security-Policy" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then

  # Set the CSP header to a default value
  echo "Header always set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'\"" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

  # Restart Apache
  service apache2 restart

fi


This script will first check if the CSP header is set in the Apache configuration file. If it is not set, the script will then set the header to a default value. Finally, the script will restart Apache so that the new header is applied.

Here is an explanation of the commands used in the script:

* `grep` - This command is used to search for a pattern in a file. In this case, we are using it to search for the string "Content-Security-Policy" in the Apache configuration file.
* `echo` - This command is used to print a string to the console. In this case, we are using it to add the CSP header to the Apache configuration file.
* `>>` - This operator is used to append text to a file. In this case, we are using it to append the CSP header to the end of the Apache configuration file.
* `service` - This command is used to start, stop, or restart a service. In this case, we are using it to restart the Apache service so that the new CSP header is applied.

I hope this helps!
