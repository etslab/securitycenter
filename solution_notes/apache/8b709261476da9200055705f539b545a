**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Enable SSL/TLS encryption:** Configure the Apache server to use SSL/TLS encryption for all communications with clients. This will prevent eavesdropping on sensitive data, including registry object access requests.
2. **Disable unneeded registry keys:** Review the registry and disable any registry keys that are not essential to the operation of the server or applications.
3. **Set appropriate permissions on registry keys:** Assign proper permissions to registry keys to restrict access to authorized users or processes only.
4. **Implement least privilege:** Ensure that users and processes only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
5. **Monitor registry activity:** Regularly review the registry for any suspicious changes or unauthorized access attempts.
6. **Use a web application firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to monitor and filter incoming traffic, blocking malicious requests that attempt to exploit registry access vulnerabilities.
7. **Patch and update:** Regularly apply security patches and updates to the Apache server and operating system to address any known vulnerabilities.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider using a centralized registry management tool to manage and audit registry settings.
* Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes.
* Educate users about the importance of protecting sensitive data and following security best practices.
