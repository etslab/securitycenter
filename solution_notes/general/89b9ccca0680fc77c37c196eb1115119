**Solution:**

1. **Use a CAPTCHA that is not easily bypassed.** This may involve using a CAPTCHA that is more complex or that is based on a different technology.
2. **Enable reCAPTCHA.** reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service from Google that is designed to be difficult to bypass.
3. **Implement additional security measures.** This may include rate limiting, requiring users to login before accessing certain pages, or using a web application firewall.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. To use a more complex CAPTCHA, you can install an extension or plugin that provides a wider range of CAPTCHA options. For example, the "Really Simple CAPTCHA" plugin for WordPress provides a variety of CAPTCHA types, including a honeypot CAPTCHA that is not visible to users.
2. To enable reCAPTCHA, you can sign up for a free API key from Google. Once you have an API key, you can add the following code to your website:

```php
<?php
// Import the reCAPTCHA library
require_once 'recaptcha-php-1.11.1/recaptcha-php-1.11.1/recaptcha/autoload.php';

// Create a reCAPTCHA instance
$recaptcha = new \ReCaptcha\ReCaptcha(YOUR_SITE_KEY, YOUR_SECRET_KEY);

// Check if the user has submitted the form
if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
  // Get the reCAPTCHA token from the form
  $token = $_POST['g-recaptcha-response'];

  // Validate the reCAPTCHA token
  $response = $recaptcha->verify($token);

  // If the reCAPTCHA token is valid, process the form
  if ($response->isSuccess()) {
    // ...
  } else {
    // The reCAPTCHA token is not valid, show an error message
    echo 'Invalid reCAPTCHA token';
  }
}
?>
```

3. There are a variety of additional security measures that you can implement to protect your website from CAPTCHA bypass attacks. For example, you can:

* **Use rate limiting.** Rate limiting involves limiting the number of requests that a user can make to your website in a given period of time. This can help to prevent attackers from submitting multiple CAPTCHA attempts in a short period of time.
* **Require users to login before accessing certain pages.** This can help to prevent attackers from accessing pages that contain sensitive information.
* **Use a web application firewall.** A web application firewall can help to block malicious traffic, including CAPTCHA bypass attacks.
