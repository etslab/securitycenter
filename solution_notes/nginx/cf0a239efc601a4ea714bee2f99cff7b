**How to fix the App Dependencies issue of gnu-utf8.tar in nginx web server:**

To fix the App Dependencies issue of gnu-utf8.tar in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the specific library that is missing or outdated.** You can do this by using the `ldd` command. For example, to check the dependencies for the `nginx` binary, you would run the following command:

```
ldd /path/to/nginx
```

This will output a list of all the libraries that nginx depends on. You can then use the `apt-get` or `yum` package manager to install or update the missing or outdated library.

2. **Restart the nginx web server.** Once you have installed or updated the missing or outdated library, you need to restart the nginx web server so that the changes can take effect.

**Which OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category does this issue belong to?**

The App Dependencies issue of gnu-utf8.tar in nginx web server belongs to the **Broken Access Control** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. This category refers to vulnerabilities that occur when an attacker is able to access resources or functionality that they are not authorized to access.

In the case of the App Dependencies issue of gnu-utf8.tar in nginx web server, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system, which could then allow them to execute arbitrary code.

**Recommendations:**

* Keep your software up to date.
* Use a strong password manager to generate and store unique passwords for all of your accounts.
* Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your website from common attacks.
* Regularly scan your website for vulnerabilities.

The gnu-utf8 package contains the GNU gettext toolkit, which is a library for translating string messages into different languages. The App Dependencies issue in gnu-utf8.tar is that it depends on a number of other packages, some of which may have vulnerabilities. This can make the nginx web server vulnerable to attack.

To fix this issue, you can upgrade the gnu-utf8 package to the latest version. This will include the latest security patches and will reduce the number of dependencies that the package has. You can also try to remove any unnecessary dependencies from the package.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category **A6: Insecure Deserialization**. This is because the gnu-utf8 package serializes and deserializes data, which can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code into the nginx web server.

To mitigate this risk, you should avoid using the gnu-utf8 package if possible. If you must use it, you should make sure that you are using the latest version and that you have removed any unnecessary dependencies. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web server from attacks.

Here are some additional tips for mitigating the risk of App Dependencies issues:

* Use a dependency management tool to manage your dependencies. This will help you to keep your dependencies up to date and to remove any unnecessary dependencies.
* Scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities regularly. This will help you to identify and fix vulnerabilities in your dependencies before they can be exploited by attackers.
* Use a WAF to protect your web server from attacks. A WAF can help to filter out malicious traffic and to prevent attacks from exploiting vulnerabilities in your web server or its dependencies.
