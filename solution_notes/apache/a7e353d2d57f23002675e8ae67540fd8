**Issue Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

**Impact:**

A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability to consume excessive CPU and memory resources on the server, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

**Solution:**

Upgrade to the latest version of `golang.org/x/net/http2`. The developers have addressed the issue in version 1.4.2 by reducing the complexity of HPACK decoding.

**Steps:**

1. Update your `go.mod` file to include the latest version of `golang.org/x/net/http2`:

```
require golang.org/x/net/http2 v1.4.2
```

2. Run `go mod tidy` to install the updated package.

3. Restart your Apache server to apply the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue was assigned CVE-2021-33566.
* The fix reduces the complexity of the HPACK decoding algorithm from O(n^2) to O(n), mitigating the potential for quadratic complexity attacks.
