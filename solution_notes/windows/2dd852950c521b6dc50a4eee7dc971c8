**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard
```

2. If the "LsaCfgFlags" value exists, right-click and select "Modify".

3. Set the Value data to:

```
0x0
```

4. If the "LsaCfgFlags" value does not exist, right-click and select "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value".

5. Name the value "LsaCfgFlags" and set the Value data to:

```
0x0
```

6. Exit the Registry Editor.

7. Restart the server.

**Explanation:**

The "LsaCfgFlags" registry value controls the behavior of the Local Security Authority (LSA), which is responsible for managing security policies and authentication. Setting this value to "0x0" ensures that the LSA is configured in a secure manner and that certain security features are enabled.

**Note:**

* This solution may require administrative privileges.
* It is important to ensure that other security policies are not affected by this change.
* Regular security audits should be conducted to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
