**Solution:**

The `filepath.Clean` function in the `path/filepath` package removes unnecessary path elements, such as `.` and `..`, from a given path. However, it does not validate whether the resulting path is safe or not. This can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities, where an attacker can access files or directories outside of the intended scope.

To fix this issue, you should validate the cleaned path before using it. This can be done by checking if the path is absolute, if it contains any special characters, and if it points to a directory that is outside of the allowed scope.

Here is an example of how to safely use the `filepath.Clean` function:

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"path/filepath"
)

func main() {
	path := "/home/user/file.txt"
	cleanedPath := filepath.Clean(path)

	if !filepath.IsAbs(cleanedPath) {
		fmt.Println("Path is not absolute")
		return
	}

	if filepath.ContainsAny(cleanedPath, `<>:"/\|?*=`) {
		fmt.Println("Path contains special characters")
		return
	}

	if !filepath.Dir(cleanedPath) == "/" {
		fmt.Println("Path is outside of the allowed scope")
		return
	}

	// Path is safe to use
	fmt.Println(cleanedPath)
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

* It is also important to note that the `filepath.Join` function can also be used to construct paths. When using this function, you should also validate the resulting path to ensure that it is safe.
* If you are using a library or framework that automatically cleans paths, you should ensure that the library or framework is properly validating the cleaned paths.
