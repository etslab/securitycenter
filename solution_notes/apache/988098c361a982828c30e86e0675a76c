**###How to fix the Certificates issue of BEAST CBC TLS ECDHE RSA AES SHA AES SHA ECDHE RSA AES SHA AES SHA DES CBC SHA in Apache web server:**

1. **Check server configuration:**
   - Ensure that the server is using TLS 1.2 or higher (TLS 1.3 is recommended).
   - Verify that the server is using a strong cipher suite that is not vulnerable to BEAST. For example, use TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
   - Ensure that the server is using a valid certificate that is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

2. **Use a web application firewall (WAF):**
   - Implement a WAF to block malicious requests that attempt to exploit BEAST.
   - Configure the WAF to inspect and filter traffic for known BEAST vulnerabilities.

3. **Disable weak ciphers and protocols:**
   - Disable weak ciphers and protocols, such as CBC mode, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1.
   - Use a server configuration tool to verify that weak ciphers and protocols are disabled.

**OWASP Top 10 Web Category:**

The BEAST CBC TLS issue falls under the **Cryptographic Failures** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.
