**Severity:** **Medium**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

## Solution

To fix this issue, you can add the following code to your Apache Server configuration:

```
<Directory /var/www/html>
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

This will restrict access to the specified directory to all users.

## Explanation

The android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_AD_ID permission is required by apps to access the advertising ID, which is a unique identifier used by Google to personalize ads. While this permission is not considered critical, it does fall under the Insufficient Logging & Monitoring category of the OWASP Top 10 2021, as it can be used to track user activity and potentially lead to privacy concerns.

By restricting access to the specified directory, you can prevent unauthorized access to the advertising ID and mitigate the risk of this issue.
