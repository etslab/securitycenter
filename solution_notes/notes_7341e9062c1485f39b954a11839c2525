**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

IP source routing allows an attacker to specify the route that packets take through a network, potentially bypassing security controls. By disabling IP source routing, you can prevent an attacker from exploiting this vulnerability.

**Solution:**

**1. Edit the Registry:**

Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
```

**2. Create DWORD Value:**

Right-click in the right pane and select "New" -> "DWORD (32-bit) Value."

**3. Name and Set Value:**

Name the new DWORD value "DisableIPSourceRouting."

Set its value to 1 (enabled).

**4. Restart Services:**

Restart the following services:

* TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper
* DHCP Client
* DNS Client

**5. Verify Change:**

Open a command prompt and run the following command:

```
netsh interface ipv4 show interface
```

Ensure that "IP Source Routing" is set to "Disabled."

**Impact:**

Disabling IP source routing may affect applications that rely on it for routing purposes. However, most modern operating systems and applications do not use IP source routing.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting is applicable to Windows operating systems.
* Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to make changes to the registry.
* It is recommended to create a backup of the registry before making any changes.
