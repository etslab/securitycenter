####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-10009 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2016-10009 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# This script patches Apache HTTP Server to remediate CVE-2016-10009.

# Check if Apache is installed.
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed.
VERSION=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')
if [[ "$VERSION" =~ ^2.4.[0-3] ]]; then
  echo "Apache $VERSION is vulnerable to CVE-2016-10009."
  echo "Patching Apache..."

  # Download the patch from the Apache website.
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/2.4/src/patches/CVE-2016-10009.patch

  # Apply the patch.
  patch -p1 < CVE-2016-10009.patch

  # Restart Apache.
  systemctl restart apache2

  echo "Patch applied successfully."
else
  echo "Apache $VERSION is not vulnerable to CVE-2016-10009."
fi
```

This script will download the patch from the Apache website, apply the patch, and restart Apache. After the patch has been applied, Apache will be no longer vulnerable to CVE-2016-10009.
