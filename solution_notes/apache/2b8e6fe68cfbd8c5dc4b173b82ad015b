**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Source of Payload:** Determine the source of the Payload/App.app/Frameworks/OneSignalOutcomes.framework/OneSignalOutcomes payload. It could be a malicious file uploaded by an attacker or a legitimate framework that requires further security measures.
2. **Update OneSignal Framework:** Check if there is a security update available for the OneSignal framework. Install the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
3. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the loading of external resources, including payloads. Configure CSP to only allow resources from trusted origins.
4. **Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to monitor and block malicious traffic. Configure the WAF to detect and block payloads that match malicious patterns.
5. **Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Regularly scan your web applications for vulnerabilities, including payload vulnerabilities. This can help identify and mitigate potential security issues.
6. **Review Access Control:** Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access to specific resources.
7. **Educate Users:** Educate users about the risks of malicious payloads and provide guidance on how to identify and avoid them.

**Note:** It's important to consult a security professional or conduct further investigation to ensure the most effective solution is implemented for your specific environment.
