**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Security Misconfiguration

**Assessment:**

The presence of apktool_out/lib/x86/libcronet.119.0.6045.31.so in an apache server indicates a security misconfiguration. This library is part of the Cronet library, which is used by Android apps to access the Internet. However, it should not be present in a server environment, as it exposes sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.

**Solution:**

1. Remove the apktool_out/lib/x86/libcronet.119.0.6045.31.so library from the server.
2. Review the server configuration to ensure that all unnecessary libraries and components are removed.
3. Implement proper access controls and security measures to protect the server from unauthorized access and exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is considered "high" severity because it represents a significant security risk if exploited.
* It is important to keep the server configuration up to date and remove any unnecessary components to minimize the attack surface.
* Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning should be performed to identify and address such misconfigurations.
