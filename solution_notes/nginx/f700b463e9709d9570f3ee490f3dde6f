**How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2019-0217 in nginx web server**

To fix the CVE-2019-0217 vulnerability in nginx, you need to upgrade to a version of nginx that is at least 1.14.0. If you are unable to upgrade, you can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the mod_auth_digest module.

To disable the mod_auth_digest module, open the nginx configuration file and locate the following line:

```
mod_auth_digest
```

Comment out this line by adding a hash mark (#) to the beginning of it.

```
#mod_auth_digest
```

Save the configuration file and restart nginx.

**Which OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category this issue belong to?**

The CVE-2019-0217 vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of Broken Authentication. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms, such as passwords and tokens.

The CVE-2019-0217 vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication by exploiting a race condition in the mod_auth_digest module. This module is used to implement digest authentication, which is a more secure form of authentication than basic authentication.

The CVE-2019-0217 vulnerability was patched in nginx 1.14.0. If you are using an older version of nginx, you should upgrade to a newer version to mitigate this vulnerability.

Here are some additional tips for securing your nginx web server:

* Use strong passwords and enforce password complexity requirements.
* Enable two-factor authentication.
* Keep your nginx software up to date.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block common attack vectors.
* Monitor your nginx server for signs of attack.
