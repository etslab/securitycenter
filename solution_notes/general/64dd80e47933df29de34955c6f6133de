**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Authentication

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Verify Request Origin:** Implement server-side checks to ensure that authentication requests originate from a trusted source. This can be done by checking the IP address or domain of the request.

2. **Implement Nonce:** Use a unique, unpredictable value (nonce) in each authentication request to prevent replay attacks. The nonce should be generated on the server-side and verified on the client-side.

3. **Enforce Session Timeout:** Set a reasonable session timeout to automatically log out users after a period of inactivity. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a device is left unattended.

4. **Use Strong Password Policies:** Implement policies that enforce password complexity, length, and regular updates. Encourage users to use different passwords for different accounts.

5. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA mechanisms such as SMS OTP or TOTP to provide an additional layer of security and prevent account takeover attempts.

6. **Patch Application Vulnerabilities:** Regularly update software and applications to patch known vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.

7. **Disable Unused Authentication Methods:** Disable authentication methods that are not in use, such as basic authentication or unencrypted HTTP connections. This reduces the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities.

8. **Monitor and Log Authentication Attempts:** Implement mechanisms to monitor and log all authentication attempts, both successful and failed. This helps in identifying suspicious activities and potential security breaches.
