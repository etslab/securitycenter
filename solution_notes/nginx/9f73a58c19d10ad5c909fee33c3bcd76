```

4. In the file, find the following line:

An expired certificate can be used by an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user or system, which can lead to data breaches or other security incidents.

Here are some additional tips to help you prevent this issue from happening again:

* Set up a certificate renewal reminder system so that you are notified when your certificates are approaching expiration.
* Use a certificate management tool to help you track and manage your certificates.
* Implement a security policy that requires all certificates to be renewed before they expire.
