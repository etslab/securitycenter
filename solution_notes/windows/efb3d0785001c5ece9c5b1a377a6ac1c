### Solution

To fix this issue, set the `fBlockNonDomain` registry value to 1. This will block non-domain requests from being forwarded to the proxy server.

**Registry Key:**

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WcmSvc\GroupPolicy
```

**Registry Value:**

```
fBlockNonDomain
```

**Data Type:**

`REG_DWORD`

**Value:**

```
1
```

### Explanation

The `fBlockNonDomain` registry value controls whether non-domain requests are forwarded to the proxy server. By default, this value is set to 0, which allows non-domain requests to be forwarded. However, this can be a security risk, as it allows attackers to bypass the firewall and access internal resources.

Setting the `fBlockNonDomain` registry value to 1 will block non-domain requests from being forwarded to the proxy server. This will help to protect internal resources from unauthorized access.
