This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive data from the application.

To prevent injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and filter all user input before it is used to generate output. You can use a web application firewall (WAF) to help prevent injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL queries.
* Use input filters to sanitize user input before it is used in an application.
* Use a WAF to help prevent injection attacks.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks.
