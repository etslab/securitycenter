####patch script to remediate  TLS1, offered (deprecated) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate TLS1, offered (deprecated) in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(pgrep httpd) ]]; then
  # Stop Apache
  systemctl stop httpd

  # Edit the Apache configuration file
  sed -i -e 's/TLSProtocol \w+/TLSProtocol all/' /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

  # Restart Apache
  systemctl start httpd

  # Check if TLS1 is no longer offered
  curl -s --tlsv1 http://localhost | grep -q "TLSv1"
  if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "TLS1 has been successfully removed."
  else
    echo "TLS1 could not be removed."
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will stop Apache, edit the Apache configuration file to remove TLS1, and then restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if TLS1 is no longer offered by Apache. If it is not, the script will print a success message. If TLS1 is still offered, the script will print an error message.

Please note that this is just a sample script and may need to be modified to work on your specific system.
