###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Private IP Disclosure
There are a few ways to fix the Web Threats issue of Private IP Disclosure in Apache web server.

* **Remove the private IP address from the HTTP response body.** This can be done by editing the Apache configuration file and adding the following line:

```
RemovePrivateIPHeaders On
```

* **Use JSP/ASP/PHP comments instead of HTML/JavaScript comments.** JSP/ASP/PHP comments are not visible to client browsers, so they can be used to hide private IP addresses.

* **Set the ServerName variable to the external hostname.** This will prevent the Apache server from revealing the internal hostname, which could be used to identify the private IP address range.

The Private IP Disclosure issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of **Information Exposure**. This category includes vulnerabilities that can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as private IP addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.

In addition to the above, there are a few other things that can be done to prevent Private IP Disclosure:

* **Use a web application firewall (WAF).** A WAF can be configured to block requests that contain private IP addresses.
* **Keep your software up to date.** Software updates often include security patches that can help to prevent vulnerabilities like Private IP Disclosure.
* **Educate your employees about security risks.** Employees should be aware of the dangers of disclosing private information and should be trained on how to protect sensitive data.

By following these steps, you can help to protect your website from the Private IP Disclosure vulnerability.
