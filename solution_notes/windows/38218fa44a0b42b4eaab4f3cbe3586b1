**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A6 - Security Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
3. Look for the `AllowAdministratorLockout` value.
4. If the value is set to 0, change it to 1.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Explanation:**

The `AllowAdministratorLockout` registry setting controls whether the Administrator account can be locked out due to failed login attempts. By default, this setting is set to 0, which means that the Administrator account is not subject to lockout. This can be a serious security risk, as it allows attackers to repeatedly attempt to log in as the Administrator until they succeed.

Setting the `AllowAdministratorLockout` value to 1 will enable lockout for the Administrator account. This will prevent attackers from repeatedly attempting to log in as the Administrator, and will help to protect the server from unauthorized access.
