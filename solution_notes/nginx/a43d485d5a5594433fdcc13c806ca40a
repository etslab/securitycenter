The App Dependencies issue of terser:4.8.0 of pkg:npm/terser@4.8.0 is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the nginx web server. This vulnerability belongs to the **Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks.

**Additional Information**

The App Dependencies feature in nginx is designed to prevent applications from using outdated or vulnerable dependencies. However, this feature can also cause problems if it is not configured correctly. For example, if you disable the App Dependencies feature, you may be vulnerable to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

If you cannot update terser to a newer version, or if you cannot disable the App Dependencies feature, you should add a dependency exception for terser. However, this is not a recommended solution, as it will leave you vulnerable to attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in terser:4.8.0.

It is important to keep your applications and dependencies up to date to mitigate the risk of attacks. You should also regularly scan your applications for vulnerabilities.
