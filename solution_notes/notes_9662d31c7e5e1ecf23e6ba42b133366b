**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Issue Description:**

The Parsedown.php library in DVWA is vulnerable to an injection vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into a web page by providing crafted input to the `markdown` function.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can use the following steps:

1. Update the Parsedown.php library to the latest version.
2. Restrict untrusted input to the `markdown` function. You can do this by using a whitelist of allowed HTML tags and attributes.
3. Encode output from the `markdown` function to prevent XSS attacks. You can do this by using the `htmlspecialchars()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it can allow an attacker to take control of a website.
* It is important to use the latest version of the Parsedown.php library and to follow secure coding practices when using this library.
