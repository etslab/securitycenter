**Detailed Solution:**

This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can bypass the CAPTCHA security mechanism by directly accessing the protected resource without providing a valid CAPTCHA response.

To fix this issue, implement the following measures:

* **Enforce CAPTCHA validation:** Ensure that CAPTCHA validation is performed on all protected pages and that the validation is not bypassed when accessing the resource directly.
* **Use strong CAPTCHA mechanisms:** Choose a CAPTCHA mechanism that is difficult to bypass, such as reCAPTCHA or similar alternatives.
* **Rotate CAPTCHA keys regularly:** Update and rotate the CAPTCHA keys frequently to prevent attackers from obtaining the key and bypassing the CAPTCHA.
* **Implement additional security measures:** Consider implementing additional security measures, such as rate limiting, IP whitelisting, or two-factor authentication, to further protect against CAPTCHA bypass attempts.
