The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is Injection. Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated user input is used to control the behavior of an application. This can lead to a variety of attacks, such as code execution, data exfiltration, and denial of service.

To prevent Injection vulnerabilities, it is important to properly validate all user input before using it in an application. This includes input from forms, cookies, and headers. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from common Injection attacks.
