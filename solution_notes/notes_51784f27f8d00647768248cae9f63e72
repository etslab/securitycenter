**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**
The "Policy Other Account Logon Events in Registry Account Logon" audit policy setting determines whether Windows logs security audit events for attempts to log on to an account other than the user's own account. When this setting is enabled, Windows logs an audit event whenever a user attempts to log on to another account, regardless of whether the attempt is successful.

If this setting is disabled or not configured, Windows will not log any audit events for attempts to log on to other accounts. This can make it difficult to detect and investigate unauthorized access to accounts.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, enable the "Policy Other Account Logon Events in Registry Account Logon" audit policy setting. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open the Local Security Policy Editor (secpol.msc).
2. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Audit Policy.
3. Double-click the "Policy Other Account Logon Events in Registry Account Logon" audit policy setting.
4. Select the "Success" and "Failure" options.
5. Click OK to save your changes.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Review your audit logs regularly to identify any unauthorized access attempts.
* Implement strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication to protect against unauthorized access.
* Monitor your systems for suspicious activity and take appropriate action as needed.
