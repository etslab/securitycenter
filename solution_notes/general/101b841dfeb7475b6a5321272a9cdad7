###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Secure Pages Include Mixed Content (Including Scripts)
There are a few ways to fix the Web Threats issue of Secure Pages Include Mixed Content (Including Scripts) in Apache web server.

* **Update the HTTP URLs in your database to HTTPS.** This will ensure that your website only ever references HTTPS in your client-side HTML. You can do this by using a tool like htaccess to create a redirect rule.
* **Use a content security policy (CSP).** A CSP is a set of rules that tells your browser what resources it can and cannot load from other websites. This can help to prevent mixed content attacks.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF).** A WAF can help to block malicious traffic and prevent mixed content attacks.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is **A1: Injection**. Injection attacks are a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a website. This malicious code can then be used to steal data, take control of the website, or perform other malicious actions.

Here are some additional tips for preventing mixed content attacks:

* Use a secure content management system (CMS). CMSs like WordPress and Drupal have built-in security features that can help to prevent mixed content attacks.
* Keep your website software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your website from attack.
* Use a strong password manager to create and store strong passwords for your website and other online accounts.
* Be careful about what information you share online. Don't share your personal information, such as your credit card number or Social Security number, unless you absolutely need to.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your website from mixed content attacks.
