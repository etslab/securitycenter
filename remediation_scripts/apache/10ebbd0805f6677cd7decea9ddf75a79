####patch script to remediate  Re-examine Cache-control Directives in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate the "Re-examine Cache-control Directives" vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    # Check if the cache-control directive is set
    grep -q "cache-control" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
      # Set the cache-control directive
      echo "cache-control no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    fi

    # Restart Apache
    service apache2 restart
  fi
fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and if the cache-control directive is set. If the directive is not set, the script will add it to the Apache configuration file. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when remediating this vulnerability:

* If you are using a different web server, you will need to check the documentation for the correct way to set the cache-control directive.
* You may also need to set the cache-control directive on individual files or directories.
* You should regularly review your Apache configuration files to ensure that they are up to date and secure.
