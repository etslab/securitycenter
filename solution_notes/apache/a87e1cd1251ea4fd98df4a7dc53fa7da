**Issue:**
Apache servers may disclose source code, such as SQL scripts, through error messages or directory listings. This can potentially expose sensitive information to attackers.

**Solution:**

1. **Disable Error Display in Production:**
   - Disable error display in production environments by modifying the `ServerTokens` and `ServerSignature` directives in the Apache configuration file.
   - Add the following lines:
     ```
     ServerTokens Prod
     ServerSignature Off
     ```

2. **Restrict Directory Listings:**
   - Disable directory listings for sensitive directories, such as those containing source code.
   - Add the following line to the `.htaccess` file in the applicable directories:
     ```
     Options -Indexes
     ```

3. **Use Virtual Hosts with Correct Privileges:**
   - Configure virtual hosts with the appropriate privileges.
   - Ensure that each virtual host has access only to its own files and directories.

4. **Implement Access Control Lists:**
   - Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
   - Use the `htaccess` file to set ACLs, for example:
     ```
     <FilesMatch "^\.sql$">
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
     </FilesMatch>
     ```

5. **Use Secure Coding Practices:**
   - Avoid using error messages that disclose sensitive information.
   - Handle errors gracefully without revealing details.
   - Use input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious code from being executed.
