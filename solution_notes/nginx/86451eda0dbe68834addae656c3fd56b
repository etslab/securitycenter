###How to fix the Certificates issue of cipherlist AVERAGE, offered in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the Certificates issue of cipherlist AVERAGE, offered in nginx web server, you can do the following:

1. Open the nginx configuration file. This file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.
2. Find the section that defines the ciphers for the HTTPS (SSL/TLS) server. This section will typically start with the keyword `ssl_ciphers`.
3. Change the cipherlist from `AVERAGE` to a more secure cipherlist. A good option is to use the `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` cipherlist.
4. Save the configuration file and restart the nginx server.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is **A1 - Injection**. This category covers vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into web applications. The use of the cipherlist `AVERAGE` can allow attackers to downgrade the security of the connection between the client and the server, which can make it easier for them to inject malicious code.

Here are some additional tips for securing your nginx web server:

* Use a strong password for the nginx server.
* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). This will force clients to use HTTPS for all connections to your server.
* Install and configure a web application firewall (WAF). This can help to protect your server from common web attacks.
* Keep your nginx software up to date. Updates often include security fixes.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your nginx web server secure.
