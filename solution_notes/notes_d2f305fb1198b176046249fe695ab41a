**Solution:**

The android_webview component in Apache Server allows untrusted input to be passed to JavaScript code. This can lead to a variety of vulnerabilities, including:

* Cross-site scripting (XSS)
* Remote code execution (RCE)
* Data exfiltration

To fix this issue, you should disable the android_webview component in Apache Server by adding the following line to your .htaccess file:

```
AddHandler None android-webview
```

You should also review the code that uses the android_webview component to ensure that it is not vulnerable to any of the attacks listed above.

**Additional Information:**

The android_webview component is no longer supported by Apache Server. It is recommended that you use a more secure alternative, such as the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF).
