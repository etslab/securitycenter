####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-10097 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-10097 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then
  # Stop Apache
  sudo systemctl stop httpd

  # Apply the patch
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2019-10097.patch

  # Restart Apache
  sudo systemctl start httpd
else
  echo "Apache is not running"
fi
```

This patch script will download the patch from the Apache Security website, apply it to the Apache source code, and then restart Apache.

Here are the steps involved in the patch script:

1. Check if Apache is running. If it is, stop Apache.
2. Download the patch from the Apache Security website.
3. Apply the patch to the Apache source code.
4. Restart Apache.

If Apache is not running, the patch script will not do anything.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when using the patch script:

* The patch script requires the Apache source code to be installed.
* The patch script has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. It may not work on other operating systems.
* The patch script may not fix all instances of CVE-2019-10097. If you are concerned about security, you should contact your system administrator.
