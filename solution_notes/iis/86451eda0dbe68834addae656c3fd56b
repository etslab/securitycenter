**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Cryptography

**Solution:**

**1. Disable AVERAGE Cipher:**

* Open IIS Manager.
* Select the server or site where the certificate is configured.
* Double-click "SSL Settings" in the Features View.
* Select the cipher suite drop-down and remove "AVERAGE" from the list.

**2. Configure a Strict Cipher List:**

* Create a new cipher list that only includes strong, modern ciphers, such as:
    * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
    * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

* Set the new cipher list as the default for the certificate.

**3. Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1:**

* TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have known security vulnerabilities.
* In IIS Manager, select "Server Certificates" in the Features View.
* Double-click the certificate and navigate to the "Bindings" tab.
* Select "Edit" and disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in the "SSL" section.

**Additional Notes:**

* The AVERAGE cipher suite allows clients to choose any cipher from the list, including weak and outdated ones.
* Using a strict cipher list ensures that only strong, modern ciphers are used for secure communication.
* Disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 prevents clients from using these insecure protocols to connect to the server.
