####patch script to remediate  CVE-2016-3115 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2016-3115 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Apache is running."
  else
    echo "Apache is not running."
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed
if [ -f /etc/apache2/version ]; then
  version=$(cat /etc/apache2/version)
  if [[ $version =~ ^2\.4\.21-.* ]]; then
    echo "Apache version $version is vulnerable."
  else
    echo "Apache version $version is not vulnerable."
    exit 0
  fi
else
  echo "Apache version cannot be determined."
  exit 1
fi

# Apply the patch
echo "Applying patch..."
patch -p1 < CVE-2016-3115.patch
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Patch failed to apply."
  exit 1
fi

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache..."
service apache2 restart
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Restart of Apache failed."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch applied successfully."
```

This patch script will check if Apache is running, if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed, and if the patch can be applied successfully. If all of these conditions are met, the patch script will restart Apache.
