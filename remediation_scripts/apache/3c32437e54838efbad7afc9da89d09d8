####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 cert expirationStatus, expires < 60 days (47) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is the patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 cert expirationStatus, expires < 60 days (47) in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then

  # Get the current date
  now=$(date +%s)

  # Get the expiration date of the SSL certificate
  cert_expiration=$(openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 2>/dev/null | grep -Po "(?<=expires=)\d{10,13}")

  # Check if the SSL certificate is expiring within 60 days
  if [ $(($(now - cert_expiration)) / 86400) -lt 60 ]; then

    # Renew the SSL certificate
    openssl renew -x509 -nodes -keyout /etc/ssl/private/apache.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt

    # Restart Apache
    service httpd restart

  fi

fi


This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current date and the expiration date of the SSL certificate. If the SSL certificate is expiring within 60 days, the script will renew the certificate and restart Apache.

Please note that this is just a basic patch script. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment.
