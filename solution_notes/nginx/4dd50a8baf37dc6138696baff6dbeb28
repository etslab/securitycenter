**Solution:**

To fix this issue, configure nginx to disable timestamp disclosure in server responses. This can be done by adding the following directives to your nginx configuration file:

```
server {
    # Disable timestamps in server responses
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header Referrer-Policy "same-origin";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';";
}
```

Make sure to restart nginx after making these changes.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static content, which can help mitigate timestamp disclosure issues.
* Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force browsers to use HTTPS for all requests to your website.
* Regularly patch and update your nginx server to address any potential vulnerabilities.
