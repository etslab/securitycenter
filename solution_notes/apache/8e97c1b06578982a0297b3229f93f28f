**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A06: Security Misconfiguration

**Explanation:**

Android_temp_file is an Android application file system path that may contain sensitive information. If an attacker can access this path, they could potentially obtain sensitive data such as user credentials, cookies, or other information. This could lead to account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive resources, or other security breaches.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should configure your Apache server to deny access to the android_temp_file path. You can do this by adding the following line to your Apache configuration file:

```
<Directory /path/to/android_temp_file>
    deny from all
</Directory>
```

You should also consider implementing other security measures to protect sensitive information on your server, such as:

* Using strong passwords and encryption
* Implementing access controls
* Regularly patching your server software
* Monitoring your server for suspicious activity
