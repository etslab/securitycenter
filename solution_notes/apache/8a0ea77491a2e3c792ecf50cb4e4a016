**Solution:**

1. Update the Apache configuration to restrict access to internal resources using the `mod_rewrite` module.

2. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of external scripts and resources.

3. Ensure that the server does not accept requests from untrusted sources by implementing proper input validation and filtering.

4. Review the codebase to identify any potential SSRF vulnerabilities and take appropriate mitigation measures.

5. Regularly scan the server for vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.
