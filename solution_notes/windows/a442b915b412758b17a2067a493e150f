**Solution:**

1. **Enable Policy RedirectionGuardPolicy:**
   - Navigate to the Registry Editor (`regedit`)
   - Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers`
   - Create a new DWORD value named `RedirectionGuardPolicy` and set its value to 1.

2. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart the apache server to apply the changes.

**Additional Considerations:**

* This policy protects against malicious websites that attempt to redirect print jobs to a different printer.
* Ensure that the `RedirectionGuardPolicy` registry key is set to 1 on all server instances.
* Monitor printer logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized print jobs.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as IP filtering and firewall rules, to prevent unauthorized access to the printer.
