**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:**
The sonarqube rule `php:S1780` flags the absence of a `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header in the HTTP response. CSP is a security header that helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other content injection attacks by restricting the sources from which the browser can load content.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to add a CSP header to your HTTP response. This can be done by adding the following code to your `.htaccess` file:

```
Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'"
```

You can customize the policy to allow specific sources by adding them to the policy. For example, to allow scripts from `example.com`, you would add the following to the policy:

```
script-src 'self' example.com
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The severity of this issue is high because it can potentially allow attackers to compromise your website through XSS attacks.
* It is important to note that CSP is not a silver bullet and should be used in conjunction with other security measures.
* For more information on CSP, please refer to the OWASP Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet: https://owasp.org/www-community/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet
