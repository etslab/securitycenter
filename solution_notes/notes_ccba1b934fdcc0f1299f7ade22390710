**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to remove the vulnerable code that echoes sensitive information, such as the following:

```php
<?php
// Incorrect (vulnerable code):
echo "Password: " . $password . "\n";
?>
```

Instead, use a secure method to log sensitive information, such as using a logging library. For example:

```php
<?php
// Correct (secure code):
logger($password);
?>
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

The rule `php:S6600` detects instances where sensitive information is echoed or printed to the user. This can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities, as attackers can access this information by viewing the source code or using tools like Burp Suite. The severity of this issue depends on the sensitivity of the information being disclosed. In the case of a password, this would be considered a medium-severity issue.

To fix this issue, you should remove the vulnerable code and use a secure method to log sensitive information. Logging libraries handle sensitive information securely and follow best practices to protect it from unauthorized access.

**Note:** This issue is related to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Sensitive Data Exposure. This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access or manipulate sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
