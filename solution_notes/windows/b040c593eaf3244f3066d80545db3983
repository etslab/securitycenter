**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A06: Security Misconfiguration

**Solution:**

To fix this issue:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\IPsec
```
3. Create a new DWORD value named "EnableMainMode" and set its value to 0.
4. Close the Registry Editor and restart the computer.

**Additional Information:**

* Enabling Main Mode in Registry Logon/Logoff allows for more flexibility in IPsec negotiation, but it can also increase the complexity and security risks associated with IPsec.
* By default, Main Mode is disabled in Registry Logon/Logoff to reduce these risks.
* Disabling Main Mode can help to protect against certain types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
