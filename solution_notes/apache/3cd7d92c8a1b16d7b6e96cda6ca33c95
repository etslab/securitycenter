Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and XSS, occur when unvalidated user input is used to dynamically generate SQL statements or HTML output. This can lead to data loss, server takeover, and other security vulnerabilities.

To prevent App Dependencies issues, you should always validate user input before using it to dynamically generate SQL statements or HTML output. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your web server from common injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing App Dependencies issues:

* Use a framework or library that handles dependency management for you.
* Keep your dependencies up to date.
* Use a version control system to track changes to your dependencies.
* Use a static analysis tool to scan your code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
* Train your developers on how to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
