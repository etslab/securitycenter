**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Update Apache HTTP Server to version 2.4.60 or later.
2. Verify that the updated version is installed. Navigate to the Apache HTTP Server installation directory and execute the following command:

```
./httpd -v
```

The output should show the updated version number (e.g., Apache/2.4.60).

**Additional Information:**

**Description:**

GNUTLS in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service by sending specially crafted requests that trigger an infinite loop.

**Impact:**

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to disrupt the operation of the web server, causing applications or services that rely on it to become unavailable.

**Mitigation:**

In addition to updating Apache HTTP Server, the following mitigation measures can be implemented to reduce the risk:

* Enable mod_evasive or another intrusion detection and prevention system to detect and block malicious requests.
* Configure Apache HTTP Server to restrict access to the server based on IP address or other criteria.
* Use a reverse proxy or firewall to handle external requests and provide an additional layer of protection.
