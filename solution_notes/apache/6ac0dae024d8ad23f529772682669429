**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Description:**

The Host header in HTTP requests can be used to specify the origin of the request. If an attacker can control the Host header, they could potentially redirect the request to a malicious website, resulting in phishing attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), or other security breaches.

**Solution:**

The issue can be fixed by properly sanitizing the Host header value in the Apache server configuration. This can be done by adding the following directive to the server's configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf):

```
Header set Host "@host_name"
```

This directive sets the Host header to the value of the `@host_name` variable, which is set to the server's hostname by default. This ensures that the Host header is always set to a known and trusted value, preventing attackers from manipulating it.

**Additional Notes:**

* If you are using a web application framework, such as Django or Rails, it may have built-in mechanisms for sanitizing HTTP headers. In this case, you may not need to implement the above solution manually.
* It is important to note that this solution only addresses the issue specifically related to the Host header. Other types of HTTP header injections may still be possible. Therefore, it is important to implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization practices throughout your application.
