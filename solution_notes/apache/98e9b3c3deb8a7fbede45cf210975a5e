**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

This issue is caused by the presence of the libfile_lock_pg.so library in the apache server's apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a directory. This library is used to manage file locking in Postgres databases and may contain sensitive information such as database connection details and database contents. Leaving this library exposed in a public-facing directory could potentially allow attackers to access sensitive database information.

To fix this issue:

1. Remove the libfile_lock_pg.so library from the apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a directory.
2. Update the application code to use a more secure method of managing file locking, such as the Java FileLock class.
3. Review the application's code and configuration to ensure that no other sensitive information is being exposed.
