* Use a dependency management tool to track the versions of all of the packages that your application uses. This will help you to identify and update any packages that have known security vulnerabilities.
* Keep your dependencies up to date. Software developers often release security updates for their packages. By keeping your dependencies up to date, you can help to protect your application from known security vulnerabilities.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to scan your web traffic for malicious code. A WAF can help to identify and block malicious code before it can reach your application.
