**Severity Assessment:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not applicable

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Edit the Registry:**

   - Navigate to: `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
   - Right-click on the Registry key and select "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value"
   - Name the new value as "LegalNoticeCaption"
   - Double-click on the "LegalNoticeCaption" value and set the Value data as follows:
     - To disable the legal notice: `0`
     - To enable a custom legal notice caption: `1`

2. **Create a Custom Legal Notice (if desired):**

   If you chose to enable a custom legal notice, you must create a file named `LegalNotice.txt` and place it in the following directory:

   - `/var/www/html`

3. **Restart Apache:**

   - Service restart: `/etc/init.d/apache2 restart`
   - Systemd restart: `/bin/systemctl restart apache2`

**Additional Information:**

* The Policy LegalNoticeCaption setting determines whether a legal notice is displayed at the bottom of the Windows login screen.
* Leaving this setting unset can lead to a confusing login experience for users, who may not be aware of the legal terms they are agreeing to.
* However, this setting does not directly affect the security of the server, so the severity is assessed as Medium.
