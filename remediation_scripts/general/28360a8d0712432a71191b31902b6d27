Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Private IP Disclosure in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current Apache version
  CURRENT_VERSION=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # Check if the current version is vulnerable
  if [[ $CURRENT_VERSION < "2.4.6" ]]; then

    # Download the latest security patch
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/httpd-2.4.6.tar.gz

    # Extract the patch
    tar -xvf httpd-2.4.6.tar.gz

    # Apply the patch
    cd httpd-2.4.6/
    ./configure
    make
    make install

    # Restart Apache
    apachectl restart

  fi

fi
```

This patch script will download the latest security patch for Apache 2.4.6, extract it, and apply it. Once the patch has been applied, you will need to restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when remediating this vulnerability:

* If you are using a version of Apache that is not listed above, you should check with the Apache Security Team to see if there is a patch available.
* You should also make sure that you have enabled the mod_ssl module in Apache. This module provides support for secure connections using SSL/TLS.
* You should also configure Apache to use a strong cipher suite. This will help to protect your data from being intercepted by unauthorized individuals.

By following these steps, you can help to protect your Apache servers from the Lucky Thirteen vulnerability.
