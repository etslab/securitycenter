**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** Injection

**Vulnerability Description:**

The code in `Test:DVWA-master/dvwa/includes/DBMS/MySQL.php` allows user-supplied input to be executed as SQL queries without any input validation or filtering. This can lead to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries to manipulate the database and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify databases, and execute administrative commands on the database server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, implement proper input validation and filtering to prevent user-supplied input from being directly executed as SQL queries. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or parameterized queries. Here's an example of how to use prepared statements:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```

In this example, the `$username` variable is bound to the `?` placeholder in the SQL query, preventing it from being directly executed as part of the query.

**Additional Security Measures:**

In addition to implementing input validation and filtering, consider implementing the following security measures:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests at the network level.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from flooding the application with requests.
* Regularly update your software and security patches to address any known vulnerabilities.
