**Solution:**

**1. Determine the current setting:**

* Use the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) to navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\EventLog\Application`.
* Check the value for the `MaxSize` key.

**2. Update the MaxSize value:**

* If the `MaxSize` value is set to 0, it means there is no maximum size limit for the Application log.
* Set the `MaxSize` value to a reasonable size, such as 2000000 (2MB). This will limit the growth of the Application log and ensure it does not consume excessive disk space.

**Steps to Update MaxSize Value:**

* Right-click on the `Application` key and select "New" -> "DWORD (32-bit) Value".
* Name the new value as `MaxSize`.
* Double-click on the `MaxSize` value and set the "Decimal" field to the desired maximum size in bytes (e.g., 2000000 for 2MB).
* Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* The maximum size of the Application log can also be configured through Group Policy.
* Regularly monitoring the size of the Application log is recommended to ensure it does not exceed the maximum size limit.
* If the Application log becomes too large, it can lead to performance issues and data loss.
