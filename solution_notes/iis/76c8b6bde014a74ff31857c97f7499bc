**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Enable CSP in IIS:**

   - Open IIS Manager.
   - Select the website you want to configure.
   - In the "Features View" pane, double-click "HTTP Response Headers".
   - In the "Add Header" dialog box, enter "Content-Security-Policy" in the "Name" field.

2. **Set a Basic CSP Policy:**

   - In the "Value" field, enter a basic CSP policy. For example:

   ```
   default-src 'self';
   ```

3. **Update the CSP Policy Gradually:**

   - Gradually add additional directives to the CSP policy to increase protection.
   - Use a CSP checker to validate your policy.

**Additional Steps:**

- Consider using a CDN that supports CSP.
- Monitor CSP violations using a security tool.
- Inform developers and content creators about CSP restrictions.
- Consider using a CSP reporting endpoint to receive notifications of CSP violations.

By implementing CSP, you can restrict the sources from which your website can load resources, reducing the risk of sensitive data exposure through script injection attacks.
