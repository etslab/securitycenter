**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Edit the nginx configuration file:** Open the nginx configuration file, typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

2. **Add the following directive:**

   ```
   server {
       ...
       location / {
           if ($query_string ~* "(username|password|email|phone|address|ssn)") {
               return 403;
           }
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

   This directive checks the query string for any of the specified PII fields and returns a 403 Forbidden error if a match is found.

3. **Test the configuration:** Restart nginx using the following command:

   ```
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```

   Test your web application to verify that PII is no longer exposed in the query string.

4. **Optional: Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF, such as ModSecurity, to provide an additional layer of protection against PII disclosure attacks.
