**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Solution:**

1. **Edit the Apache Server Configuration File:**
   - Navigate to the Apache server configuration file (usually `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`) and add the following line:

   ```
   EnableSendfile off
   ```

2. **Restart Apache Server:**
   - Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

**Explanation:**

* The `AuditBaseDirectories` setting in the Apache server controls whether the server can access the files in specific directories.
* When this setting is enabled, an attacker could send a specially crafted request that causes the server to access sensitive files outside the intended root directory.
* This can lead to sensitive information disclosure or other security risks.
* The `EnableSendfile` option allows the server to send files directly to the client without reading them into memory, which can improve performance.
* However, it is not necessary for SSRF attacks and can be disabled to mitigate the risk.
