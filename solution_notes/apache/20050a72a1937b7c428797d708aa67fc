    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\LanmanWorkstation
    ```
3. Create a new DWORD value (32-bit) named "AllowInsecureGuestAuth."
4. Set its value to 0 (disabled).
5. Restart the server for the changes to take effect.

* When this policy is enabled, Windows can allow anonymous users to access shared network resources without authentication.
* Disabling this policy ensures that only authenticated users can access shared network resources.
