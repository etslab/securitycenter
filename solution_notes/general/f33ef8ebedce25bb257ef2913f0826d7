**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Remove Unnecessary Permissions:**

* Review the AndroidManifest.xml file to ensure that the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission is only requested when it is absolutely necessary. If it is not essential for the application's functionality, remove the permission declaration.

**2. Use Background Permission Prompts:**

* If possible, implement background permission prompts in the application. This allows users to grant or deny location access on an as-needed basis, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**3. Secure Location Data:**

* Encrypt any sensitive location data stored on the Apache server. Use strong encryption algorithms and ensure that the encryption keys are kept secret.
* Implement rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent excessive location requests.
* Consider using anonymization techniques to protect user privacy.

**4. Harden Apache Server:**

* Install security patches and updates regularly to address any vulnerabilities in the server.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests and protect against attacks.
* Configure Apache server settings to limit access to sensitive resources and prevent unauthorized access.

**5. Implement Logging and Monitoring:**

* Enable detailed logging in Apache server to track all location-related requests.
* Monitor log files regularly for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
* Set up alerts to notify administrators of any unusual events or security breaches.
