**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control (CWE-284)

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the vulnerable component:** Determine if the vulnerable file is being used by the web application and if so, locate the corresponding code using a tool like grep or locate.

2. **Remove or restrict access:** If the vulnerable file is not necessary for the web application, remove it from the file system. If it is required, modify the file permissions to restrict access to authorized users only.

3. **Update the application:** If the vulnerable component is part of a third-party library or plugin, update it to a patched version that addresses the security issue.

4. **Implement input validation and sanitization:** Ensure that any user-controlled input is properly validated and sanitized before being used to dynamically generate file paths or access restricted resources.

5. **Secure file uploads:** Implement robust file upload mechanisms that check for malicious file types and restrict uploads to designated and protected directories.

6. **Monitor and log suspicious activity:** Regularly review application logs and security events for any suspicious file system access attempts. Implement mechanisms to alert on anomalous behavior.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Use a vulnerable assessment tool:**定期地使用漏洞评估工具扫描您的服务器，以检测已知的漏洞。
* **Disable unused services and ports:**关闭未使用的服务和端口以减少攻击面。
* **Keep software up to date:**应用最新的安全补丁和软件更新以修复已知的漏洞。
* **Implement a web application firewall:** A web application firewall can help block malicious requests that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
