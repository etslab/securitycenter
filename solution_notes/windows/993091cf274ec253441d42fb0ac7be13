**Severity:** High

**Description:**

Policy Logoff in Registry Logon/Logoff is a registry key that specifies whether to log off the user upon policy change. By default, this key is set to 0, meaning that the user is not logged off when a policy change occurs. This can allow an attacker to hijack a user's session by modifying the user's policies.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy Logoff in Registry Logon/Logoff registry key to 1. This will force the user to log off whenever a policy change occurs.

**Registry Key:**

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
```

**Value Name:**

```
PolicyLogoff
```

**Value Type:**

```
REG_DWORD
```

**Value Data:**

```
1 (Enabled)
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This solution applies to Windows versions 7 and later.
* This solution can also be implemented through Group Policy.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, to further protect against session hijacking attacks.
