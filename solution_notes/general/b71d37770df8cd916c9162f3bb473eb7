**Solution:**

**1. Disable the Policy DCSettingIndex value:**

Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power\PowerSettings
```

Locate the "DCSettingIndex" DWORD and set its value to 0.

**2. Restart the Apache server:**

```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

**Additional Information:**

The Policy DCSettingIndex value specifies the default power plan to be used by the system. By disabling this value, you prevent the system from automatically switching to a low-power plan, which can potentially lead to performance issues.

**Note:** Before making any changes to the registry, it is recommended to create a backup in case of any errors.
