**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to disable the `Server` header in your Apache configuration. This can be done by adding the following line to your `.htaccess` file:

```
Header unset Server
```

Alternatively, you can disable the `Server` header in your Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`):

```
ServerTokens Prod
```

This will set the `Server` header to "Apache" instead of the full version number.

**Explanation:**

The `Server` header is an HTTP header field that provides information about the web server software that is serving the request. This information can be used by attackers to identify the specific version of the web server software that is running, which can help them to exploit known vulnerabilities in that software.

By disabling the `Server` header, you can make it more difficult for attackers to gather information about your web server software and exploit vulnerabilities in it.
