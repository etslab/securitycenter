This issue belongs to the **A1: Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is allowed to enter a command or query string. In this case, the attacker is able to inject a malicious regular expression into the `urlToRequest()` function, which can cause the application to crash or consume excessive resources.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* **Sanitize all user input.** This includes validating user input for expected characters and formats, and escaping any special characters.
* **Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.** This will help to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF).** A WAF can help to protect your application from a variety of attacks, including injection attacks.
