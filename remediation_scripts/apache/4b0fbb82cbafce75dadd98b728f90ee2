####patch script to remediate  HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header cannot be set as site contains an invalid certificate chain in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header cannot be set as site contains an invalid certificate chain in Apache HTTP Server:


#!/bin/bash

# Check if the HSTS header is already set
if grep -q "HSTS" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "HSTS header is already set"
  exit 0
fi

# Check if the certificate chain is valid
if openssl verify -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/apache.pem; then
  echo "Certificate chain is valid"
else
  echo "Certificate chain is invalid"
  exit 1
fi

# Set the HSTS header
echo "Header always set Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000 includeSubDomains" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart


This script will first check if the HSTS header is already set. If it is, the script will exit without making any changes. If the HSTS header is not set, the script will check if the certificate chain is valid. If the certificate chain is valid, the script will set the HSTS header to a value of 31536000 seconds (one year) and include subdomains. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

After the script has been run, you can verify that the HSTS header has been set by visiting your website in a web browser and checking the response headers. The HSTS header should be present and should have a value of 31536000 seconds (one year).
