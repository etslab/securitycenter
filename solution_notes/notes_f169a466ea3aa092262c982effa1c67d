**Additional Considerations:**

* The EnableGuestAccount policy allows anonymous users to access the Apache server, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
* By disabling this policy, you prevent unauthorized access by anonymous users, reducing the risk of attacks.
* Regularly review the Apache server configuration to ensure that security settings, such as authentication policies, are properly configured.
