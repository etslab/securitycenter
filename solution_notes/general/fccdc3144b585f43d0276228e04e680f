**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Not applicable

**Detailed Solution:**

The issue occurs when the build tag line contains deeply nested logical expressions, such as:

```
// +build !((!a && !b) || (!c && !d))
```

The recursive parsing of these expressions can lead to a deep call stack, causing a panic in Go versions prior to 1.16.

To fix the issue, refactor the build tag line to remove any deep nesting. For example, the above line could be rewritten as:

```
// +build !a || !b || !c || !d
```

**Mitigation Steps:**

1. Identify all build tag lines with deeply nested logical expressions.
2. Refactor the build tag lines to remove the deep nesting.
3. Run `go version` to ensure that you are using Go version 1.16 or later. If you are using an older version, upgrade to 1.16 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

* The issue is present in Go versions prior to 1.16.
* The panic can occur when the build tag line is parsed by the `go/build` package.
* It is recommended to use the latest version of Go to avoid potential bugs and security vulnerabilities.
