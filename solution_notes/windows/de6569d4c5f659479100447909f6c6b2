**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Solution:**

1. **Enforce Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application pool identity for the web server has only the minimum necessary permissions. This will prevent it from accessing unauthorized Registry keys.
2. **Disable Unnecessary Registry Keys:** Identify any Registry keys that are not required for the application to function and disable or remove them.
3. **Implement Input Validation:** Validate all input data to ensure that it contains valid Registry keys and paths.
4. **Use a Registry Lockdown Policy:** Implement a Group Policy to prevent unauthorized access to the Registry. This can be achieved by creating a Registry Lock Policy (RLP) and applying it to the web server.
5. **Monitor Registry Access:** Monitor Registry access logs to detect any suspicious activity.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can filter out malicious requests and block SSRF attempts.
* **Consider using a Virtual Private Server (VPS):** A VPS can provide better isolation and control over the Registry.
* **Use a dedicated server:** A dedicated server provides greater flexibility and control over the Registry settings.
