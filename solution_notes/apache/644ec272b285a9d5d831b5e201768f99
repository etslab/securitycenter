**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A08:2021-Injection

**Description:**
The issue arises due to insufficient validation and sanitization of user input. The code in `DVWA-master/dvwa/includes/DBMS/MySQL.php` allows for directly building SQL queries using user input, without properly sanitizing or filtering it. This can lead to injection attacks, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or manipulate the database.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, implement thorough input validation and sanitization measures to prevent malicious SQL queries. Here's a revised code snippet:

```php
<?php
// ... existing code

// Sanitize the user input
$input_cleaned = mysqli_real_escape_string($link, $input);

// Build the SQL query using the sanitized input
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$input_cleaned'";

// ... remaining code
?>
```

**Steps to Fix:**

1. Identify all user-controlled inputs that are used to construct SQL queries.
2. Implement input validation techniques to verify the type, format, and expected range of the input.
3. Use appropriate input sanitization methods (e.g., `mysqli_real_escape_string()`) to remove malicious characters that could be used to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. Consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to further mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly review and update the code to ensure it adheres to best security practices.
* Implement a comprehensive security policy that includes measures to prevent injection attacks.
* Train developers on the importance of input validation and sanitization.
