**Solution:**

1. **Enable Audit Logging for Registry Changes:**
   - In the Apache httpd.conf file, add the following directive:
   ```
   LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\" %D %T %a" combined
   CustomLog logs/registry_audit combined
   ```
   - This logs all registry key access in the "logs/registry_audit" file.

2. **Restrict Access to Sensitive Registry Keys:**
   - In the Apache httpd.conf file, add the following directive:
   ```
   <Directory "path/to/sensitive/registry/keys">
       Deny from all
   </Directory>
   ```
   - This prevents unauthorized access to specified registry keys.

3. **Use Secure Registry Editor:**
   - Use a registry editor that supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, such as regedit with the "/s" option:
   ```
   regedit /s
   ```

4. **Monitor Registry Changes:**
   - Use tools like RegShot or AuditPol to monitor registry changes and detect unauthorized modifications.

5. **Implement IDS/IPS:**
   - Deploy an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS) to monitor for suspicious registry activity.

6. **Implement IAM:**
   - Implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system to control access to registry resources based on user roles and permissions.

7. **Consider Least Privilege:**
   - Only grant users the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the potential impact of unauthorized access.
