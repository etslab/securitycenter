**Solution:**

Implement proper captcha validation on the captcha_bypass.php page to ensure that users cannot bypass the CAPTCHA protection. This can be achieved by using a third-party CAPTCHA library or by implementing custom validation logic to check for valid CAPTCHA responses.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Update the captcha_bypass.php page to include captcha validation before allowing users to proceed.
2. If using a third-party library for CAPTCHA, follow the specific integration instructions provided by the library.
3. If implementing custom validation, include these steps in the captcha_bypass.php page:
   - Generate a CAPTCHA challenge and display it on the page.
   - Store the expected CAPTCHA response in the session or other secure location.
   - When the user submits the form, compare the entered response with the stored expected response.
4. If the CAPTCHA validation fails, display an error message and prevent the user from proceeding (e.g., by redirecting them to the login page).

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a strong CAPTCHA implementation that is resistant to common bypass techniques.
* Consider using reCAPTCHA or other widely trusted CAPTCHA solutions.
* Enforce CAPTCHA validation on all pages where unauthorized access could lead to sensitive data compromise.
