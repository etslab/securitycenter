**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

The issue is caused by the use of the `$_GET` variable without proper validation or sanitization. To fix it, you should:

1. Validate the input to ensure it is in the expected format and range of values.
2. Sanitize the input to remove any potentially malicious characters or code.

Here is an example of how to fix the issue:

```php
// Get the input from the GET variable
$input = $_GET['input'];

// Validate the input
if (!is_numeric($input)) {
    throw new InvalidArgumentException('The input must be a number.');
}

// Sanitize the input
$input = htmlspecialchars($input);

// Use the sanitized input
// ...
```

**Additional Notes:**

* The severity of this issue is high because it could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into your application, which could lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
* This issue is a common security vulnerability, so it is important to be aware of it and take steps to mitigate it.
* You can use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from this and other security vulnerabilities.
