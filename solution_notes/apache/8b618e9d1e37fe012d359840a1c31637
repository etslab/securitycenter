**Severity: Medium**

The absence of the DisableNotifications policy setting weakens the Windows Firewall by allowing malicious programs to disable notifications and evade detection. However, this issue is not critical as other security measures are likely in place.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile`
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `DisableNotifications`.
4. Set the value data to `0`.
5. Close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Mitigation:**

* Regularly scan the server for malware.
* Monitor Windows Firewall logs for suspicious activity.
* Implement additional security measures such as intrusion detection systems and web application firewalls.
