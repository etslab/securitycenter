**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A7: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Enable Registry Auditing:**

```
AuditPol.exe /set /subcategory:"Registry" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

2. **Configure Audit Privilege Use Policy:**

Use the Local Security Policy Editor (gpedit.msc):

* Go to Security Settings > Local Policies > Audit Policy.
* Double-click "Audit Use of Privileged Rights on Local System".
* Check "Audit attempts to perform privileged operations".
* Select "Success" and "Failure".

3. **Apply Audit Policy:**

```
gpupdate /force
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that important registry keys are protected and only accessible to authorized users.
* Monitor registry audit logs for suspicious activity.
* Implement least privilege access controls to prevent escalation of privileges.
