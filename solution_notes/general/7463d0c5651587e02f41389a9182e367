**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Description:**
The Platform Policy Change in Registry Policy Change in apache server vulnerability allows attackers to modify the policy settings of the registry, potentially granting them unauthorized access or control over the system.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to restrict access to the registry policy settings to authorized users only. This can be achieved by configuring the appropriate permissions in the apache server configuration files. Additionally, you should consider implementing additional security measures such as:

* Enabling request validation to prevent malicious requests from being processed.
* Implementing input sanitization to prevent malicious data from being passed to the server.
* Using a web application firewall to block malicious requests.

**Steps to Fix the Issue:**

1. Open the apache server configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf).
2. Add the following directive to the configuration file:

```
<Directory "/path/to/registry_policy">
    Require all denied
</Directory>
```
3. Replace "/path/to/registry_policy" with the actual path to the registry policy directory.
4. Save and close the configuration file.
5. Restart the apache server.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly review and update the apache server configuration to ensure that all necessary security measures are in place.
* Implement a vulnerability management program to identify and patch vulnerabilities promptly.
* Monitor the server logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
