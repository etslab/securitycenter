**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A06: Security Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Enable Caching:**

* Modify the web.config file and add the following lines:

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <staticContent>
    <clientCache cacheControlMode="UseMaxAge" cacheControlMaxAge="60:00:00" />
  </staticContent>
</system.webServer>
```

**2. Set Custom Cache Headers:**

* In IIS, open the website's properties and navigate to the "HTTP Response Headers" tab.
* Add a new header with the following settings:
    * **Name:** Cache-Control
    * **Value:** public, max-age=3600 (or a custom value as needed)

**3. Verify the Headers:**

* Use a browser extension like "Web Developer" or "Firebug" to check the response headers of static content.
* Ensure that the Cache-Control header is set and has the appropriate value.

**Additional Mitigation Steps:**

* Enable GZIP compression to reduce file sizes.
* Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache content closer to users.
* Set Expires headers to specify when content should expire.

**Reason for High Severity:**

The absence of cache-control headers can significantly increase bandwidth usage and server load, leading to performance issues and potential denial-of-service attacks. It also prevents browsers from effectively caching static content, which can slow down website loading times for users.
