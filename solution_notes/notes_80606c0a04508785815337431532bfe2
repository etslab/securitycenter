**Solution:**

The issue of cipher order is related to the order in which ciphers are listed in a configuration file, such as the TLS configuration file. The order of the ciphers determines which cipher will be used when establishing a secure connection.

To fix this issue, the cipher order should be configured to prioritize strong ciphers that provide adequate security. Weak or insecure ciphers should be removed from the list. The following steps outline how to address this issue:

1. **Review the Cipher Order:** Check the cipher order in the relevant configuration file. It may be in a TLS configuration file or within the server software configuration.
2. **Identify Weak Ciphers:** Research and identify any weak or insecure ciphers that are present in the list.
3. **Reorder or Remove Weak Ciphers:** Place strong ciphers at the top of the list and remove any weak or insecure ciphers.
4. **Test and Validate:** Save the configuration changes and test the new cipher order. Use SSL/TLS scanning tools to verify that the server is using strong ciphers and that weak ciphers are no longer included.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Keep the cipher list up-to-date with the latest recommendations from industry best practices and security advisories.
* Regularly review and audit the cipher order to ensure that it remains secure.
* Consider using a library or framework that automatically manages cipher order based on security best practices.
