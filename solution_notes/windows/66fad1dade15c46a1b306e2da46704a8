This setting will enable full privilege auditing, which logs all attempts by users to access objects with full privileges, including attempts to create, delete, or modify sensitive files or registry keys.

**Additional Information:**

FullPrivilegeAuditing is a Windows registry setting that controls whether or not all attempts to access objects with full privileges are audited. When this setting is enabled, the operating system will log all attempts to access objects with full privileges, including attempts to create, delete, or modify sensitive files or registry keys. This information can be used to detect and investigate suspicious activity on the server.

It is recommended to enable FullPrivilegeAuditing in production environments to help detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
