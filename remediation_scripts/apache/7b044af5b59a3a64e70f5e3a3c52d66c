####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-10098 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-10098 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check the Apache version
current_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

# If the Apache version is vulnerable, apply the patch
if [[ $current_version -lt "2.4.40" ]]; then
  echo "Applying patch for CVE-2019-10098..."
  wget https://security.apache.org/cve/CVE-2019-10098.patch
  patch -p1 < CVE-2019-10098.patch
fi

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache..."
apache2ctl restart

# Check if the patch was successful
if ! apache2ctl -t; then
  echo "The patch was not successful."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch applied successfully."
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and running. If it is, the script will check the Apache version and apply the patch if the version is vulnerable. The script will then restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the patch was successful.

Please note that this is just a sample patch script. You may need to modify it to work with your specific Apache installation.
