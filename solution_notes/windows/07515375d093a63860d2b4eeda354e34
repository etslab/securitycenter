**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2 - Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

Policy Start in Registry SYSTEM-CurrentControlSet-Services-MrxSmb10 in the Apache server is set to 3, which allows any user to start the SMBv1 service. This can lead to unauthorized access to shared files and other network resources.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the Policy Start value should be set to 0, which disables the SMBv1 service. This can be done by following these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MrxSmb10`
3. Double-click the **Start** value and set it to **0**.
4. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Disable SMBv1 on all servers and clients to prevent unauthorized access to network resources.
* Use strong passwords and encryption to protect shared files and folders.
