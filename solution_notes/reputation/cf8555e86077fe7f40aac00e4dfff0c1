## Axiatix.com Online Reputation Report & Improvement Guidance

This report analyzes the provided security status data for axiatix.com and offers recommendations to improve its online reputation.

**Summary:**

Axiatix.com, a cybersecurity consulting firm, presents a mixed security profile. While some aspects are strong (e.g., long domain expiry, valid SSL certificate), others are concerning (e.g., `dmarc=none`, spoofing detected).  The company's name and website purpose create a strong expectation of high security standards, which are not fully met by the current security posture.  This discrepancy can negatively impact its online reputation.


**Detailed Analysis:**

**Positive Aspects:**

* **Long Domain Expiry (domain_expiry2: 2027-09-23):** This indicates a long-term commitment to the online presence, which builds trust.
* **Valid SSL Certificate (cert_expiry: 2025-06-04, domain_ssl: Lets Encrypt, ssl_issue: 0):**  HTTPS encryption is essential for security and builds user confidence.  Renewal before expiry is crucial.
* **Clean Malware Scan (malware: 0):**  Absence of malware is vital for maintaining a positive reputation.
* **Good HTTP Status (http_status: 200):**  Indicates the website is functioning correctly.
* **Appropriate Open Ports (open_ports: 80/tcp, 443/tcp):**  Standard ports for HTTP and HTTPS are open, as expected.
* **Website Title Accuracy (site_title: Axiatix: Expert Consulting in Cybersecurity and Technology | Axiatix):**  Accurately reflects the company's services.


**Negative Aspects:**

* **Spoofing Detected (spoofing: 1):** This is a critical issue.  It suggests that emails from or seemingly from axiatix.com could be forged, damaging trust and potentially impacting deliverability. This needs immediate attention.
* **DMARC Record Missing (dmarc_record: v=DMARC1; p=none):**  The absence of a DMARC record with a `p=reject` or `p=quarantine` policy leaves the domain vulnerable to email spoofing. This significantly hurts reputation and deliverability.  This is directly related to the spoofing issue.
* **Blacklist Listing (blacklist: 6):**  Being listed on six blacklists is a serious concern, indicating potential issues like spam emails or malicious activity associated with the domain. Immediate investigation and remediation are necessary.  Identify which blacklists and work on removing the domain.
* **Lack of Web Application Firewall (waf: Not Found):**  A WAF is essential for protecting against common web attacks, especially for a cybersecurity firm.  The absence of one exposes the website to various vulnerabilities.
* **SPF Record uses a 3rd party (spf_record: v=spf1 include:_spf.mail.hostinger.com ~all):** While this works, managing SPF records through a third party can create dependency issues and complicate troubleshooting. Ideally, it should be managed directly.  However, this alone isn't a major security risk.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Address Spoofing & DMARC:**  This is the most urgent task.  Implement a robust DMARC policy (start with `p=quarantine` then move to `p=reject` after testing) and investigate the root cause of the spoofing. This likely involves configuring proper email authentication mechanisms (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and ensuring only authorized servers send emails on behalf of axiatix.com.
2. **Investigate and Remove Blacklist Listings:**  Determine which blacklists have flagged axiatix.com.  Identify and rectify the underlying problems causing the blacklisting (e.g., compromised email accounts, spam emails sent from the domain). Request removal from the blacklists after addressing the issue.
3. **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF provides an essential layer of security by filtering malicious traffic before it reaches the website's server.  Consider cloud-based WAF solutions or integrating one with the hosting provider.
4. **Review and Tighten Email Security:**  Ensure strong password policies are in place for all email accounts.  Regularly scan for malware and unauthorized access. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
5. **Monitor Security Regularly:**  Use a security monitoring tool to track changes in the website's security posture and promptly address any new issues.
6. **Consider a Professional Security Audit:**  A thorough security audit by an independent firm can identify hidden vulnerabilities and provide tailored recommendations.  This would be particularly beneficial given the company's focus on cybersecurity.
7. **Improve Transparency:**  Publicly share information about the company's security measures on the website to build trust with clients.


By addressing these issues, Axiatix.com can significantly improve its online reputation, build greater client confidence, and align its security posture with the high standards expected of a cybersecurity consulting firm.  The lack of a WAF and the spoofing/DMARC issues are the highest priorities. Ignoring these will significantly damage its credibility.
