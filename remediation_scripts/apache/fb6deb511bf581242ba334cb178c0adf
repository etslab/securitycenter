####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 TLS session ticket, valid for 216000 seconds (>daily) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 TLS session ticket, valid for 216000 seconds (>daily) in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(ps -ef | grep httpd | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then

  # Get the current value of the `MaxSessionTicketLifetime` directive
  current_value=$(grep -Po "MaxSessionTicketLifetime\s*=\s*([0-9]+)" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf)

  # If the current value is greater than 216000, then update it to 216000
  if [ "$current_value" -gt 216000 ]; then
    echo "MaxSessionTicketLifetime 216000" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    # Restart Apache
    service apache2 restart
  fi

else

  echo "Apache is not running."

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the current value of the `MaxSessionTicketLifetime` directive. If the current value is greater than 216000, then the script will update the directive to 216000. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

Please note that this is just a sample patch script. The specific steps required to remediate this vulnerability may vary depending on the specific version of Apache that you are using.
