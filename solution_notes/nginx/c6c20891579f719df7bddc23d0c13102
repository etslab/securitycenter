###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of paramiko-2.7.1.tar.gz:paramiko-2.7.1.tar:jquery.js in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
paramiko-2.7.1.tar.gz:paramiko-2.7.1.tar:jquery.js contains the JavaScript library jquery.js, which is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

To fix this issue, you can either upgrade to a newer version of jQuery that has been patched for XSS vulnerabilities, or you can implement XSS filtering on your nginx web server.

To upgrade jQuery, you can use the following command:

```
npm update jquery
```

To implement XSS filtering on your nginx web server, you can add the following configuration to your nginx configuration file:

```
location / {
  # Enable XSS filtering
  mod_security on;
  mod_security_rules /path/to/mod_security_rules.conf;
}
```

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category for this issue is **A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

Here are some additional tips for preventing XSS attacks:

* Use a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the types of scripts that can be executed on your web pages.
* Encode all user input before displaying it on your web pages.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious requests before they reach your web server.
