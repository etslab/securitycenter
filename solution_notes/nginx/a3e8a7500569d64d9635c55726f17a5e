To fix the App Dependencies issue of ansi-html:0.0.7 of pkg:npm/ansi-html@0.0.7 in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Update the package to a newer version. The latest version of ansi-html is 0.0.10, which has fixed the security vulnerability.
2. If you are unable to update the package, you can mitigate the vulnerability by disabling the `ansi-html` filter in nginx.

To disable the `ansi-html` filter in nginx, edit the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` file and remove the following line:

```
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  '' close;
}

upstream php-upstream {
    server unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://php-upstream;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

        # Disable the ansi-html filter
        filter_off;

        if (!-f $request_filename) {
            rewrite ^/(.*)$ /index.php?/$1 last;
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have made the changes, save the file and restart nginx.
