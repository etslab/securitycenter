**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Cause:**

An incomplete certificate chain occurs when the client cannot trace the certificate back to a trusted root certificate authority (CA) due to missing intermediate certificates. This breaks the chain of trust and prevents the client from verifying the server's identity.

**Impact:**

* Man-in-the-middle attacks: Adversaries can intercept and modify traffic by spoofing the server's certificate.
* Session hijacking: Attackers can impersonate the server and take over user sessions.
* Eavesdropping: If the traffic is not encrypted, attackers can eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted over the connection.

**Solution:**

1. **Obtain and install all intermediate certificates:** Obtain the missing intermediate certificates from the CA and install them on the Apache server.
2. **Configure the virtual host:** Add the following directives to the virtual host configuration in the Apache configuration file:
    - `SSLCertificateFile` - Path to the server certificate.
    - `SSLCertificateKeyFile` - Path to the server private key.
    - `SSLCertificateChainFile` - Path to the intermediate certificate chain.
3. **Restart Apache:** Restart Apache to apply the configuration changes.

**Verification:**

After implementing the solution, you can use the following commands to verify the certificate chain:

```
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts
```

This command should output a complete certificate chain, including the server certificate, all intermediate certificates, and the root CA certificate.
