**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue:**
The Registry Object Access in Apache Server allows access to sensitive registry objects and keys, potentially exposing configuration data and other sensitive information to unauthorized users.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Disable Registry Object Access**
- Open the Apache httpd.conf configuration file.
- Locate the following directive:
```
LoadModule access_compat_module modules/mod_access_compat.so
```

- Comment out this directive by adding a "#" symbol at the beginning of the line.

**Step 2: Remove Registry Key Read/Write Access**
- Open the Windows Registry Editor (regedit).
- Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Apache Software Foundation\Apache HTTP Server
```

- Find the following keys and delete them:
    - ReadKeys
    - WriteKeys

**Step 3: Restart Apache**
- Restart the Apache service to apply the changes.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Implement role-based access controls to restrict access to registry objects based on user privileges.
- Regularly audit registry key permissions to ensure that only authorized users have access.
- Consider implementing a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests that attempt to access sensitive registry objects.
