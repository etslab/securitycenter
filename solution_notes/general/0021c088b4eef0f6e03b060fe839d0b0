**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile
```

2. Create or modify the following DWORD value:

```
Name: EnableFirewall
Type: REG_DWORD
Value: 1
```

3. Click "OK".

* **Explanation:**

The Policy EnableFirewall registry key determines whether the Windows Firewall is enabled for private networks. When set to 0, the firewall is disabled. Setting it to 1 ensures that the firewall is active and protecting the system.

* **Impact:**

If the firewall is not enabled, the server is vulnerable to unauthorized network access and attacks. This can compromise sensitive data or allow attackers to gain control of the system.

* **Recommendation:**

It is strongly recommended to keep the Windows Firewall enabled to protect the server from potential threats. This is a common security measure that should be implemented on all systems connected to the network.
