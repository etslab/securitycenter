**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard`.
3. Create or modify the following DWORD value:

```
Value Name: ConfigureKernelShadowStacksLaunch
Value Data: 1
```

4. Save the changes and restart the server.

**Explanation:**

The Policy ConfigureKernelShadowStacksLaunch setting enables Kernel Shadow Stacks (KSS) for all processes launched by the system, providing additional protection against stack buffer overflow attacks. By setting this value to 1, you ensure that KSS is enabled and helps mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks, which can be used to access and manipulate internal resources from outside the server.
