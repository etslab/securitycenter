To fix the Certificates issue of cipherlist OBSOLETED, offered in apache web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Apache configuration file. This file is usually located at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
2. Find the section that contains the cipherlist directive. This directive is usually located near the top of the file.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is A1: Injection. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into web applications. By injecting malicious code, attackers can take control of the application or steal sensitive data.

Here are some additional tips for preventing this type of vulnerability:

* Use a secure cipherlist. A secure cipherlist is one that uses strong encryption algorithms and does not allow for weak ciphers.
* Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect against vulnerabilities.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF). A WAF can help to block common attack vectors, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject malicious code.
