**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Improper Configuration Security (A7)

**Solution:**

1. **Verify Permissions:** Ensure that the `apktool_out/lib/armeabi-v7a/libbuffer_pg.so` file is not publicly accessible. Set appropriate file permissions to restrict access to authorized users only.

2. **Configure Web Server:** Harden the Apache server configuration to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories. Use mechanisms like `.htaccess` or server-level configuration to protect sensitive areas.

3. **Review Codebase:** Examine the codebase for any potential vulnerabilities that may allow unauthorized access to the sensitive file. Address any security vulnerabilities identified.

4. **Use a Security Scanner:** Periodically scan the server and codebase using security scanners to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Educate Users:** Train users on best practices for securing sensitive files and directories. Emphasize the importance of restricting file access to authorized personnel only.

6. **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review server and application logs for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly update the server and software components to patch any known vulnerabilities.
* Implement a vulnerability management program to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities in the system.
* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests and protect the server from exploitation attempts.
