**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Injection

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, remove the `X-Powered-By` header from the HTTP responses. This can be done by adding the following directive to the Apache configuration file:

```
Header unset X-Powered-By
```

This directive will instruct Apache to remove the `X-Powered-By` header from all HTTP responses.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `X-Powered-By` header is a common header that is added to HTTP responses by web servers. It provides information about the web server software that was used to generate the response.
* While the `X-Powered-By` header is not a security vulnerability in and of itself, it can be used by attackers to identify the software that is running on a web server. This information can then be used to launch targeted attacks against the web server.
* Removing the `X-Powered-By` header can help to reduce the risk of these types of attacks.
