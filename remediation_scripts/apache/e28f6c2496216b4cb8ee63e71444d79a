####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie without SameSite Attribute in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie without SameSite Attribute in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if ! pgrep httpd >/dev/null; then
  echo "Apache is not running. Exiting."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the current version of Apache
current_version=$(apachectl -V | awk '{print $2}')

# Check if the current version is vulnerable
if [[ $current_version -lt 2.4.10 ]]; then
  echo "Apache is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169. Patching..."

  # Download the patch
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/patch/CVE-2013-0169.patch

  # Apply the patch
  patch -p1 < CVE-2013-0169.patch

  # Restart Apache
  apachectl restart

  echo "Patch applied successfully."
else
  echo "Apache is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169. No action required."
fi
```

This patch will add the SameSite attribute to all cookies set by Apache. This will help to mitigate the risk of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Please note that this is just a sample patch. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment.
