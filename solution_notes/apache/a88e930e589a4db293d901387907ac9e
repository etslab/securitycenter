**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure (A03)

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy\35378EAC683F11D2A89A00C04FBBCFA2
   ```

2. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named "NoBackgroundPolicy" if it doesn't exist.

3. Set the value of "NoBackgroundPolicy" to 0 (disabled).

**Explanation:**

The NoBackgroundPolicy registry setting controls whether background applications and services are automatically closed when the user logs on. If this setting is set to 1 (enabled), background processes will be terminated, which can cause stability issues and prevent important services from running.

By disabling NoBackgroundPolicy, you ensure that essential background applications and services will continue to run even after the user logs on. This helps mitigate the risk of data exposure by ensuring that sensitive data is not accidentally left unattended or terminated.

**Additional Notes:**

* This registry setting is specific to Windows operating systems.
* It is recommended to only disable NoBackgroundPolicy if necessary, as it may impact system performance.
* Manually disabling NoBackgroundPolicy will override any group policies that have been applied to the machine.
