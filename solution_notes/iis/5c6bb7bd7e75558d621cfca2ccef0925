**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Injection

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious comments from being submitted. This can be done by:

1. **Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can be configured to detect and block suspicious comments based on predefined rules or custom filters.
2. **Implementing Input Validation on the Server-Side:** Validate all user-supplied input on the server-side using regular expressions or other validation techniques. For example, ensure that only valid characters are allowed in comments and that the length of the comment does not exceed a predefined threshold.
3. **Sanitizing Input Before Display:** Before displaying comments on the website, sanitize them to remove any potentially malicious content. This can be done using HTML or SQL escaping techniques.
4. **Limit User-Controllable Input:** Reduce the amount of user-controllable input by limiting the characters that can be used, the length of comments, and the number of comments that can be submitted per user or time period.
5. **Use Honeypots:** Create decoy fields or elements in the comment form that should not be visible to legitimate users. If these fields are filled out, it indicates that a bot or malicious actor is submitting the comment.
6. **Implement Captcha or reCAPTCHA:** Use CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA mechanisms to prevent automated bots from submitting comments.
7. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Regularly monitor your website for suspicious comments or patterns of activity that may indicate an attack.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Update your IIS web server software to the latest version.
* Configure IIS to block or restrict access to sensitive directories and files.
* Enable SSL/TLS encryption to protect data in transit.
* Implement secure headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks.
