**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the DisableIPSourceRouting value to 1 in the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
```

1. Open the Registry Editor by typing "regedit" (without quotes) into the Windows search bar and clicking on the Registry Editor icon.
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
```
3. In the right-hand pane, locate the "DisableIPSourceRouting" DWORD value. If it does not exist, you can create it by right-clicking in the right-hand pane, selecting "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value," and naming it "DisableIPSourceRouting."
4. Double-click on the "DisableIPSourceRouting" DWORD value and set its "Value data" to "1."
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The "DisableIPSourceRouting" registry setting prevents a remote attacker from spoofing source IP addresses in IP packets, thereby mitigating attacks that rely on IP address spoofing, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. By setting this value to 1, IP source routing is disabled, preventing attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities related to IP address spoofing.
