**Issue Description:**

When an HTTP request contains an unusually large number of HTTP headers or cookies, it can lead to an excessive memory allocation in the Apache server's processes. This can cause the server to become unresponsive or crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack.

**Solution:**

To mitigate this issue, you can implement the following steps:

1. **Configure MaxHeaderCount:** Set the `MaxHeaderCount` directive in Apache's configuration file (httpd.conf) to limit the maximum number of HTTP headers that can be received in a request.
2. **Configure MaxCookieCount:** Similarly, set the `MaxCookieCount` directive to limit the maximum number of cookies that can be received in a request.
3. **Use Request Limiting:** Implement request limiting mechanisms to prevent an attacker from sending a large number of requests in a short span of time.
4. **Enable Header and Cookie Parsing Protection:** Use Apache modules like mod_security or mod_rpaf to protect against malicious HTTP requests with excessive headers or cookies.

**Additional Considerations:**

* It is important to note that setting excessively low values for `MaxHeaderCount` and `MaxCookieCount` could interfere with legitimate traffic.
* Request limiting can help mitigate the issue, but it may need to be carefully configured to avoid impacting legitimate users.
* Regularly monitoring server logs and performance metrics is crucial to detect any suspicious activity related to excessive memory allocation.
