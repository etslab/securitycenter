###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of glob-parent:3.1.0 of pkg:npm/glob-parent@3.1.0 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the App Dependencies issue of glob-parent:3.1.0 of pkg:npm/glob-parent@3.1.0 in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Update the `glob-parent` dependency to a newer version.
2. If you are unable to update the `glob-parent` dependency, you can try to mitigate the issue by:
    * Adding a web application firewall (WAF) to your nginx web server.
    * Configuring your nginx web server to block requests that contain malicious patterns.
    * Disabling the use of the `glob-parent` dependency in your application.

This issue belongs to the **A1: Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021. Injection is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. This code can then be executed by the web application, giving the attacker control over the application.

In the case of the `glob-parent` dependency issue, an attacker could inject malicious code into a web application by passing a malicious pattern to the `glob-parent` function. This code could then be executed by the web application, giving the attacker control over the application.

To mitigate the risk of injection attacks, it is important to validate all user input before using it in a web application. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as input validation and SQL escaping.
