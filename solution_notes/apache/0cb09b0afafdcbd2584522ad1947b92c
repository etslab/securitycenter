**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Issue:**
The Policy DenyDeviceClasses registry key is not set to disallow the installation of removable storage devices, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Solution:**
1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions
```
3. In the right-hand pane, right-click and create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `DenyDeviceClasses`.
4. Double-click on the newly created `DenyDeviceClasses` value and set the Value data to `20480` (hexadecimal). This value represents removable storage devices.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Notes:**
* Restart the Apache server after making the registry changes.
* Regularly review and update the DenyDeviceClasses registry key to ensure that all unauthorized device classes are blocked.
