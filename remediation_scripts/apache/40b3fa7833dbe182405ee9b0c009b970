####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-0197 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-0197 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is vulnerable, patch it
  if [[ $apache_version -lt 2.4.39 ]]; then
    echo "Patching Apache..."
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz
    tar -xvf httpd-2.4.39.tar.gz
    cd httpd-2.4.39
    make
    make install

    # Restart Apache
    apache2ctl restart

    echo "Apache patched successfully."
  else
    echo "Apache is not vulnerable."
  fi

else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and, if it is, check the version of Apache. If Apache is vulnerable, the script will download the latest patched version of Apache, extract it, compile it, and install it. The script will then restart Apache.

Please note that this is just a sample script and may need to be modified to work on your specific system.
