####patch script to remediate  CVE-2022-30556 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2022-30556 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  apache_version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is older than 2.4.54, then patch it
  if [[ $apache_version -lt 2.4.54 ]]; then

    # Download the patch
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/CVE-2022-30556.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2022-30556.patch

    # Restart Apache
    sudo systemctl restart apache2

  fi

fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is running and, if it is, it will check the version of Apache. If Apache is older than 2.4.54, then the patch script will download the patch and apply it. Once the patch is applied, Apache will be restarted.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when applying this patch:

* The patch script should be run as root or with sudo privileges.
* The patch script should only be run on systems that are running Apache 2.4.53 or older.
* After the patch is applied, Apache should be restarted.
