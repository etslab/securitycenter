**Severity:** High

**Reason:** The Policy ForceKerberosForRpc registry key enforces the use of Kerberos for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) traffic between clients and servers. RPC is a protocol used for communication between applications running on different computers. By disabling this policy, an attacker could potentially perform man-in-the-middle attacks and intercept or manipulate RPC traffic.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\RPC
    ```
3. Create a new DWORD value named "ForceKerberosForRpc".
4. Set the value data to 1.
5. Restart the computer.
