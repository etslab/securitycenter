**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Impact:**

The android_logging module can expose sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and debugging data, to a remote attacker. This information could be used to compromise the application or user accounts.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should disable the android_logging module in your Apache server configuration. You can do this by editing the httpd.conf file and adding the following line:

```
LoadModule android_logging_module modules/mod_android_logging.so
```

Once you have made this change, you need to restart your Apache server to apply the new configuration.

**Additional Recommendations:**

In addition to disabling the android_logging module, you should also take the following steps to protect against sensitive data exposure:

* Use strong encryption to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
* Implement input validation to prevent attackers from submitting malicious data.
* Regularly review your code for vulnerabilities and apply patches as needed.
