**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:**

The CredSSP (Credential Security Support Provider) is a protocol that enables Windows systems to authenticate to remote servers securely. However, if the Policy AllowEncryptionOracle value for CredSSP is not set to 0, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to retrieve plain-text credentials during the authentication process.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the following registry key to 0:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters\AllowEncryptionOracle
```

**Steps:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the key specified above.
3. Double-click the AllowEncryptionOracle value.
4. Set the value data to 0.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Mitigation:**

* Disable CredSSP authentication if possible.
* Use a strong encryption algorithm for CredSSP authentication.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for access to sensitive resources.
* Regularly monitor for suspicious activity and review security logs.
