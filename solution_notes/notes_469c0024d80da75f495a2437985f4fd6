**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The presence of the apktool_out/lib/x86/libapminsighta.so in the Apache server directory indicates that the server may be compromised due to insufficient access controls. This shared object library (`.so`) is typically associated with the monitoring tool "AppDynamics APM" and its presence outside of the expected installation directory suggests a potential unauthorized modification or installation.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the source of the vulnerability:** Determine how the `libapminsighta.so` library was installed on the server. This may involve reviewing server logs, access logs, or system configuration files.
2. **Remove the vulnerable library:** Delete the `apktool_out/lib/x86/libapminsighta.so` library from the server.
3. **Review access controls:** Evaluate the server's access control configuration to identify any weaknesses or misconfigurations. Ensure that only authorized users have access to critical directories and files.
4. **Update software and security patches:** Install the latest security patches and updates for the server and its components. This includes the Apache server, operating system, and any installed monitoring tools.
5. **Monitor for suspicious activity:** Implement intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms to monitor for any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

**Additional Considerations:**

* It is essential to investigate the root cause of the vulnerability to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
* Consider using a secure server configuration tool to help identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review and update access controls to ensure they remain effective.
