**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Enable audit logging for registry changes:**
   - On Linux systems, use the `auditd` service to audit registry changes. Configure `auditd` to log all write operations to registry keys relevant to Apache server configuration, such as `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Apache2`.
   - On Windows systems, use the Group Policy Editor to enable auditing for registry changes. Configure the policy to audit all write operations to the relevant registry keys.

2. **Configure permissions to restrict registry access:**
   - Grant only necessary permissions to users or groups who need to make changes to the Apache server configuration registry keys.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to define permissions at a granular level.

3. **Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity:**
   - Regularly review audit logs for any suspicious registry changes, such as modifications made by unauthorized users or changes to critical settings.
   - Set up alerts to notify administrators of any unusual audit events.

4. **Implement Apache server hardening:**
   - Follow best practices for Apache server hardening, such as:
     - Disabling unnecessary modules
     - Limiting access to sensitive directories
     - Configuring secure headers and HTTP methods
     - Keeping Apache software up to date

**Impact of Issue:**

If attackers can modify registry settings related to Apache server configuration, they can:

* Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data
* Execute arbitrary code on the server
* Alter server behavior to redirect traffic or launch attacks
* Evade detection by disabling audit logging or modifying audit trails
