###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2016-8858
CVE-2016-8858 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server. It can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

To fix this vulnerability, you need to upgrade to a patched version of the Apache HTTP Server. You can find the latest patched version on the Apache website.

This vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category of Injection. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or malicious data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Here are some additional tips for preventing and mitigating injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection attacks.
* Sanitize all user input before it is used in a web application.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
* Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks.
