**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive information. This can be done by:

* Verifying the user's identity before granting access to any sensitive resources.
* Using strong authentication mechanisms, such as two-factor authentication (2FA).
* Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
* Regularly reviewing and updating access control policies to ensure they remain effective.
* Monitoring access logs to detect any suspicious activity.

**PHP Code Fix:**

```php
<?php
// ...

// Check if the user is logged in
if (!isset($_SESSION['logged_in'])) {
    header('Location: login.php');
    exit;
}

// ...
?>
```

This code snippet checks if the user is logged in before allowing access to the page. If the user is not logged in, they are redirected to the login page.
