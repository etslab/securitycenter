**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A06: Security Misconfiguration

**Description:**

`net/http/httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy` is a function in the Go standard library used for setting up a reverse proxy. By default, it includes the `X-Forwarded-For` header in the proxied requests. However, in an Apache server environment, this can lead to security issues if the reverse proxy is misconfigured, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing attackers to bypass security measures.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, explicitly set the `X-Forwarded-For` header to an empty string before proxying the request:

```go
proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(targetURL)
proxy.Transport = &http.Transport{
    Proxy:           http.ProxyFromEnvironment,
    DisableKeepAlives: true,
}

proxy.ModifyResponse = func(resp *http.Response) error {
    resp.Header.Del("X-Forwarded-For")
    return nil
}
```

**Steps to Verify Solution:**

1. Make a request to the reverse proxy.
2. Check the `X-Forwarded-For` header in the proxied request.
3. It should be empty.
