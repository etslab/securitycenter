####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310  in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -n "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Stop Apache
  sudo service httpd stop

  # Apply the patch
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2013-0169.patch

  # Restart Apache
  sudo service httpd start

else

  # Apache is not running, so no need to patch or restart
  echo "Apache is not running, so no need to patch or restart."

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will stop Apache, apply the patch, and then restart Apache. If Apache is not running, the script will simply print a message stating that no action is required.
