**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A06: Security Misconfiguration

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the following registry key:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers
DisableWebPnPDownload = 1 (DWORD)
```

**Explanation:**

The DisableWebPnPDownload registry key prevents users from downloading printer drivers from the internet. This helps prevent attackers from installing malicious drivers on the system.

By default, this registry key is set to 0, which allows users to download printer drivers from the internet. However, it is recommended to set this key to 1 to prevent unauthorized driver downloads.
