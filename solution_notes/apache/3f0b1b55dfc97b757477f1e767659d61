**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Insecure Design

**Issue Description:**

The file `apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libtacrashclone_dumper.so` is part of a native library used by the Android operating system. If this file is accessible on the web server, it could potentially be exploited by attackers to gain access to sensitive system information or execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the file `apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libtacrashclone_dumper.so` is not publicly accessible via the web server. This can be done by adding the following line to the server's configuration file (e.g., `.htaccess`):

```
deny from all
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep all software and libraries up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests.
* Monitor your server for suspicious activity and investigate any potential security incidents promptly.
