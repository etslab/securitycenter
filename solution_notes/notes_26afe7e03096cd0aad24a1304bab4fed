**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Description:**
The php:S4833 rule in SonarQube detects potential SQL injection vulnerabilities where user-supplied data is inserted into a database query without proper validation and escaping. In the provided context of `Test:DVWA-master/dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php`, this rule identifies the use of the `$input` variable, which contains user-supplied data, without proper validation or escaping before being included in a database query.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that user-supplied data is properly validated and escaped before being included in a database query. This can be achieved by using prepared statements or by manually escaping the data using appropriate techniques such as `htmlspecialchars()` or `addslashes()`.

Here's an example of how to fix the issue using prepared statements:

```php
// Create a prepared statement
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");

// Bind the user-supplied data to the prepared statement
$stmt->bind_param("s", $input);

// Execute the prepared statement
$stmt->execute();
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a security framework or library to handle user input validation and escaping to reduce the risk of injection vulnerabilities.
* Perform thorough testing and code review to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.
* Regularly update your software and dependencies to address any known security vulnerabilities.
