**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Understand the Permission:** The `android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` permission allows an app to change the state of network connectivity (e.g., enable/disable Wi-Fi or mobile data). This permission is dangerous because it can be used to disrupt network access for other apps or the entire device.

2. **Minimize Permission Use:** Only request this permission if your app absolutely requires it. Consider using alternative methods or leveraging system APIs to achieve your desired functionality without requiring this permission.

3. **Limit Permission Exposure:** If your app must request this permission, be cautious about exposing it to third-party libraries or components. Use a permission guard or other mechanism to control when and how this permission is used.

4. **Review Code for Permission Usage:** Thoroughly review all code that accesses the `android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` permission to ensure it is used appropriately and only when necessary.

5. **Use Best Practices for Permission Handling:** Implement industry best practices for permission handling, such as requesting permissions during runtime, providing clear and concise permission explanations, and handling permission denials gracefully.

**Additional Mitigation Measures:**

* **Disable Network Connectivity:** If your app no longer requires network access, disable network connectivity to minimize the potential impact of this permission being exploited.
* **Consider Sandbox:** Run your app in a sandbox or protected environment to restrict its access to system resources, including network connectivity.
* **Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems:** Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor network activity and detect any suspicious or malicious attempts to change network state.

By implementing these measures, you can reduce the risk associated with the `android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE` permission and improve the overall security of your Apache server.
