The App Dependencies issue of gnu-sparse-big.tar in nginx web server belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of "Injection". This category includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's code, configuration, or data. Once the attacker has injected malicious code, they can execute it on the application's server, which can allow them to steal data, take control of the server, or disrupt the application's operations.

Here are some tips to help you prevent App Dependencies issues:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to scan your web traffic for malicious code.
* Keep your web application software up to date.
* Use a secure coding methodology to develop your web applications.
* Implement input validation to prevent users from injecting malicious code into your web applications.
* Use a content management system (CMS) that has been designed with security in mind.
* Educate your users about the dangers of clicking on links in emails or on websites that they do not trust.
