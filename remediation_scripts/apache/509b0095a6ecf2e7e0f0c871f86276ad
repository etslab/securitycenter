####patch script to remediate  cipher-tls1 X Weak Ciphers Identified in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate cipher-tls1 X weak ciphers identified in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current ciphers
  current_ciphers=$(apachectl -t | grep "SSLCipherSuite" | sed -e "s/.*=//")

  # Check if any weak ciphers are enabled
  weak_ciphers=$(openssl ciphers -v | grep "NULL" | sed -e "s/.*://")

  # If any weak ciphers are enabled, disable them
  if [ "$weak_ciphers" != "" ]; then
    echo "Disabling weak ciphers..."
    apachectl -t -DSSLCipherSuite="$current_ciphers,$weak_ciphers"
  fi

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the current ciphers that are enabled. The script will then check if any of these ciphers are weak. If any weak ciphers are found, the script will disable them.

This script should be run as root.
