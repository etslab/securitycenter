**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Problem:**
The Policy LogDroppedPackets is set to false, which means that dropped packets are not logged. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot network connectivity issues and detect potential security breaches.

**Solution:**
Set the Policy LogDroppedPackets registry key to true to enable logging of dropped packets.

**Steps to Fix:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging
```
3. Create or modify the DWORD value "LogDroppedPackets" and set its value to 1 (true).
4. Close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Information:**

* Enabling logging of dropped packets can increase the size of the firewall log files over time.
* It's important to regularly review the firewall logs and take appropriate action based on the information contained within.
