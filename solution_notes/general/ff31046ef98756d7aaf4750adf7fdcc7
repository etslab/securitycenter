###How to fix the Web Threats issue of CSP: script-src unsafe-inline
The Web Threats issue of CSP: script-src unsafe-inline in apache web server can be fixed by removing the `unsafe-inline` directive from the Content Security Policy (CSP) header. The `unsafe-inline` directive allows inline scripts to be executed, which can be a security risk. By removing this directive, you will prevent any inline scripts from being executed, which will help to protect your website from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is **A1: Injection**. XSS attacks are a type of injection attack that can be used to inject malicious code into a website. This malicious code can then be executed by the victim's browser, which can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information or take control of the victim's computer.

Here are some additional steps you can take to protect your website from XSS attacks:

* Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of JavaScript, CSS, and other resources that can be loaded on your website.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
* Sanitize all user input before it is used in your website.
* Keep your software up to date.

By taking these steps, you can help to protect your website from XSS attacks.
