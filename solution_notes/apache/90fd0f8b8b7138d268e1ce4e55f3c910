**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
```

Right-click on the "Explorer" key and create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named "NoAutoplayfornonVolume". Set its value to 1.

**Explanation:**

The NoAutoplayfornonVolume registry value controls whether autorun is disabled for removable drives. By default, autorun is enabled for non-volume devices, such as USB drives. This can allow malicious code to be executed automatically when a USB drive is inserted into a computer. Disabling autorun for non-volume devices mitigates this risk.
