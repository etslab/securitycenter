**Description:**
The sonarqube rule php:S1488 flags potential security vulnerabilities in PHP code where user input is directly used in a dynamic query without proper sanitization or input validation. This vulnerability can allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the application and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you should implement proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user input is safe before it is used in dynamic queries. This can be achieved using various techniques such as:

* **Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it meets expected data types, lengths, and formats.
* **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user input to remove malicious characters or sequences that could be used for SQL injection attacks.
* **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements to execute dynamic queries and prevent SQL injection attacks by binding user input as parameters.

In the specific case of DVWA, the vulnerable code is located in `dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php` and can be fixed by using a prepared statement to execute the SQL query:

```php
$stmt = $db->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly review your code for potential security vulnerabilities.
* Use a web application scanner to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
* Implement security best practices such as input validation, sanitization, and secure coding techniques.
