**More information about the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category A3: Injection:**

Injection is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web application. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

Injection attacks can be used to steal data, compromise accounts, or even take control of a web application.

**To prevent injection attacks:**

* Validate all user input before using it in a query or command.
* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with databases.
* Use an escape function to encode all user input before it is displayed on the web page.
* Keep your software up to date and apply security patches promptly.

**Additional tips for preventing injection attacks:**

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web application from common attacks.
* Implement a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the types of scripts that can be executed on your web pages.
* Educate your developers about injection vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.
