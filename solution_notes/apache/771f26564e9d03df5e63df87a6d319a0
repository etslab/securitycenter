**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

**Solution:**

1. **Add NSCameraUsageDescription to the Info.plist file:**

   In the Xcode project, navigate to the Info.plist file for your app. Add a new key called "NSCameraUsageDescription" and provide a clear description of why the app requires access to the camera.

2. **Update the App Transport Security (ATS) settings:**

   In the Info.plist file, add the following key and value:

   ```xml
   <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
   <dict>
     <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
     <false/>
   </dict>
   ```

3. **Enable SSL pinning:**

   Integrate an SSL pinning library to verify the authenticity of the server's SSL certificate before establishing a connection. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Implement logging and monitoring:**

   Configure your server to log all camera usage events. Monitor these logs regularly for any suspicious activity, such as excessive camera access or unauthorized modifications to the camera settings.

5. **Consider using the AVCaptureSession API:**

   Use the AVCaptureSession API to control camera access in a more granular manner. This allows you to specify exactly when and how the camera is used, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Explanation:**

The NSCameraUsageDescription audit issue occurs when an iOS app requests access to the camera but doesn't provide a clear explanation to the user about why the app needs this permission. Without proper justification, the user may be reluctant to grant access, which could impact the app's functionality.

By implementing the above solutions, you can ensure that your app clearly communicates its camera usage intent to the user, protects user privacy, and complies with Apple's App Store guidelines.
