**Description:**

The Policy AllowLocalPolicyMerge registry setting controls whether local firewall policies can merge with Group Policy-defined firewall policies. When set to 1, local policies can override Group Policy settings, potentially weakening the overall firewall protection.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue and harden the firewall configuration:

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile
   ```
2. Locate the `AllowLocalPolicyMerge` DWORD value.
3. Double-click the DWORD value and set its value to `0`.
4. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Impact:**

Leaving this setting enabled allows local users to modify the firewall settings, potentially bypassing Group Policy restrictions and creating security vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**

Disabling this setting prevents local users from overriding Group Policy-defined firewall settings, ensuring that the firewall remains configured according to the organization's security policies.
