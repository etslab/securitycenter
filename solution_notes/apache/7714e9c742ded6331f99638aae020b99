**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Authentication

**Impact:**

* Weak password policies allow attackers to easily guess or brute-force passwords, gaining unauthorized access to the system.

**Solution:**

**1. Set a Strong Minimum Password Length:**

* Edit the Windows Registry:
    * Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AdmPwd`
    * Create or edit the DWORD value **MinimumPasswordLength**
    * Set the value to at least 12, ensuring that passwords are complex and difficult to guess.

**2. Enforce Password Complexity Requirements:**

* Ensure that passwords must contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Use password complexity checkers like zxcvbn.

**3. Additional Considerations:**

* Disable password reuse: Windows can be configured to prevent users from setting new passwords that are the same as their previous passwords.
* Limit login attempts: Implement lockout policies to restrict the number of failed login attempts before locking out the account.
* Use multi-factor authentication (MFA): Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide an additional form of authentication, such as a one-time password (OTP).

**Verification:**

* Check the Windows Registry to ensure that **MinimumPasswordLength** is set to an appropriate value.
* Test password complexity requirements by attempting to set weak passwords.
* Verify that login attempts are limited and locked out after a certain number of failures.
