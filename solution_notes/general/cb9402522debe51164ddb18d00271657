**Solution:**

**1. Disable the Registry Key:**

* Navigate to "Registry Editor" by pressing Windows Key + R and typing "regedit".
* Locate the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
```
* Right-click on the "Terminal Services" key and select "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value".
* Name the new value "fUseMailto" and set its value to "0".

**2. Restrict Access to Mailto Protocol:**

* In the Apache configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf), add the following directive:
```
<Directory /path/to/directory>
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
</Directory>
```
* Replace "/path/to/directory" with the actual directory where mailto attachments are handled.

**3. Block Mailto URLs in HTTP Request Header:**

* In the Apache configuration file, add the following directive:
```
Header always unset Content-Type "multipart/form-data; protocol=mailto:*"
```
* This will remove the mailto URL from the HTTP request header, preventing the server from processing it.

**4. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

* Implement a WAF that monitors and blocks malicious traffic, including mailto-based attacks.

**5. Enable Input Validation:**

* Ensure that the server validates user input, including potential mailto attachments, to prevent malicious code execution.
