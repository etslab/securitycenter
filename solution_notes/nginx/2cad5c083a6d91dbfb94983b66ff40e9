**How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2017-6168 in nginx web server**

CVE-2017-6168 is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Nginx web server that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.

To fix this vulnerability, you need to upgrade to a version of Nginx that is no longer affected by the vulnerability. The affected versions of Nginx are:

* Nginx 1.10.2 and older
* Nginx 1.11.9 and older
* Nginx 1.12.4 and older

If you are unable to upgrade to a newer version of Nginx, you can mitigate the vulnerability by applying the following workaround:

1. Open the Nginx configuration file (usually `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) in a text editor.
2. Add the following line to the `http` block of the configuration file:

```
location / {
    limit_req zone=$binary_remote_addr burst=10 nodelay;
}
```

3. Save the configuration file and restart Nginx.

This workaround will limit the number of requests that a single IP address can make to Nginx in a given period of time. This will help to mitigate the RCE vulnerability by making it more difficult for an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request that can exploit the vulnerability.

**Which OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category does CVE-2017-6168 belong to?**

CVE-2017-6168 belongs to the following OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category:

**A2: Broken Authentication and Session Management**

This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit weaknesses in authentication and session management mechanisms to compromise user accounts or hijack sessions. CVE-2017-6168 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server without requiring authentication, which makes it a critical vulnerability that falls into this category.

It is important to note that the OWASP Top 10 Web is a prioritized list of the most common and dangerous web application security risks. It is not an exhaustive list of all possible web application vulnerabilities. However, it is a good starting point for organizations that are looking to improve the security of their web applications.
