**Description:**

The Policy AllowDomainPINLogon registry key allows domain users to log on using a PIN. This can weaken security because PINs are generally less secure than passwords.

**Solution:**

Disable the Policy AllowDomainPINLogon registry key by setting its value to 0.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Registry Editor by searching for "regedit" in the Windows search bar.
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`
3. Right-click on the "AllowDomainPINLogon" key and select "Modify".
4. Change the "Value data" to 0 and click "OK".
5. Restart the server.

**Additional Information:**

* By disabling the Policy AllowDomainPINLogon registry key, you are preventing domain users from logging on using a PIN.
* This will help to improve security because PINs are generally less secure than passwords.
* It is important to note that this setting only affects domain users. Local users will still be able to log on using a PIN.
* If you need to allow domain users to log on using a PIN, you can configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to enable the "Allow PIN logon for domain users" policy setting.
