**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System
   ```
2. Locate the `AllowDomainPINLogon` value and set it to `0`.
3. Restart the server.

**Explanation:**

The `AllowDomainPINLogon` registry setting controls whether users can log on to the domain using a PIN. By default, this setting is enabled, which allows for password spraying attacks. By disabling this setting, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.
