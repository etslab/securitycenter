**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Injection

**Detailed Solution:**

The `Web:ImgWithoutAltCheck` rule in SonarQube flags images without alternative (alt) text. Alt text provides a description of the image to help screen readers and search engines understand its content, especially for users with visual impairments.

To fix this issue, you need to add `alt` attributes to all images in your web application. Here's an example:

```html
<img src="image.png" alt="Description of the image">
```

**Steps to fix the issue:**

1. Identify all images in your web application that lack `alt` attributes.
2. Add appropriate `alt` text to each image.
3. Re-run the SonarQube scan to verify that the issue is resolved.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The `alt` text should accurately describe the image's content.
* Avoid using generic `alt` text like "image" or "picture."
* Use concise and informative `alt` text that is relevant to the context of the image.
