The CVE-2020-11993 issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of Injection. Injection flaws, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), occur when unvalidated or unfiltered user input is used to dynamically generate SQL statements or HTML output. Injection flaws can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server or steal sensitive data from the application.

To prevent injection flaws, it is important to validate and filter all user input before it is used to generate dynamic SQL statements or HTML output. You can use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL statements.
* Use input filters to sanitize user input.
* Do not trust user input for anything that is sensitive, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
* Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.

By following these tips, you can help protect your website from injection attacks.
