**Fixing the Certificate Issue for Cipherlist 3DES IDEA**

1. **Disable 3DES IDEA Cipherlist:**
   - Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf)
   - Locate the following line:
     `SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH"`
   - Remove "3DES IDEA" from the cipherlist. The final line should look like:
     `SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH"`
2. **Update Certificate Files:** If using a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a non-trusted authority, install a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.
3. **Restart Apache:** Restart the Apache web server for the changes to take effect.
