####patch script to remediate  CVE-2017-15906 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2017-15906 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current version of Apache
  version=$(apachectl -V | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}')

  # If the version is less than 2.4.25, then patch the vulnerability
  if [[ $version -lt "2.4.25" ]]; then

    # Download the patch from the Apache website
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/CVE-2017-15906.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2017-15906.patch

    # Restart Apache
    apachectl restart

  fi

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current version of Apache. If the version is less than 2.4.25, then the script will download a patch from the Apache website and apply it. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

It is important to note that this is just a sample patch script. You may need to modify it to fit your specific environment. For example, you may need to change the path to the Apache binary or the location of the patch file.

You can also use a vulnerability scanner to scan your system for CVE-2017-15906. If the scanner finds the vulnerability, it will typically provide instructions on how to remediate it.
