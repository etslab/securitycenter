###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of t32.exe in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
The App Dependencies issue of t32.exe in nginx web server is a **Broken Access Control** issue, which is category A2 of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 list.

Broken Access Control occurs when an attacker can access data or functionality that they should not have access to. This can be caused by a number of factors, including:

* Weak or nonexistent authentication and authorization controls
* Improper configuration of security settings
* Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware

In the case of t32.exe, this issue can occur if the nginx web server is configured to allow users to execute arbitrary code. This could allow an attacker to upload a malicious file and execute it on the server, giving them access to sensitive data or functionality.

To fix this issue, you should:

* Ensure that the nginx web server is configured to only allow users to execute authorized code.
* Keep the nginx web server software up to date.
* Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common attacks.

Here are some additional steps you can take to mitigate the risk of Broken Access Control attacks:

* Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.
* Implement least privilege access, so that users only have the access they need to perform their job duties.
* Regularly review security settings and make sure they are configured correctly.
* Scan your web applications for vulnerabilities and patch them promptly.

By taking these steps, you can help to protect your web server from Broken Access Control attacks and other security threats.
