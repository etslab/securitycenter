####patch script to remediate  cert trust, certificate does not match supplied URI (same wo SNI) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script that can be used to remediate the "cert trust, certificate does not match supplied URI (same wo SNI)" issue in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep -f httpd) ]; then

  # Get the current configuration file
  conf_file="/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"

  # Check if the SNI directive is enabled
  if grep -q "SSLOptions +StdEnvVars" $conf_file; then

    # Get the URI from the error message
    uri=$(echo $1 | cut -d'"' -f2)

    # Get the certificate from the error message
    cert=$(echo $1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

    # Check if the certificate matches the URI
    if ! openssl verify -CAfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt -verbose $cert $uri; then

      # The certificate does not match the URI, so we need to update the configuration file
      echo "SSLCertificateFile $cert" >> $conf_file

      # Restart Apache
      systemctl restart httpd

    fi

  fi

else

  echo "Apache is not running"

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, it will then get the current configuration file and check if the SNI directive is enabled. If it is, the script will then get the URI and certificate from the error message and check if they match. If they do not match, the script will update the configuration file with the correct certificate and restart Apache.
