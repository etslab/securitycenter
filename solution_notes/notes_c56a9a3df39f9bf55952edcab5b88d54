**Solution:**

1. **Install the Device Guard Toolkit:** Download and install the Device Guard Toolkit from Microsoft.
2. **Enable Software Restriction Policies (SRP):** Go to "Local Security Policy" (secpol.msc) and navigate to "Software Restriction Policies". Enable SRP by right-clicking on it and selecting "Enable Software Restriction Policies".
3. **Create a Deny Rule for Printers:** Right-click on "Software Restriction Policies" and select "New Deny Rule". In the "Path" field, enter the following:

```
C:\Windows\system32\printui.dll
```

4. **Set the Policy Level to "Enforced":** In the "Enforce" tab, select "Enforce this policy" and click "OK".
5. **Restart the Server:** Reboot the Apache server to apply the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* This solution assumes that you use printers that are not connected directly to the server. If you have printers connected directly, you will need to modify the above path to match the specific printer DLL.
* You can also use the Device Guard Toolkit to create more granular rules and restrictions. Refer to Microsoft's documentation for more details.
