**Severity Assessment:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description:**

The Policy 1206 registry key, located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3`, allows users to modify the security settings for the "Restricted" zone in Microsoft Internet Explorer. By setting this key to a non-zero value, users can bypass security restrictions and potentially access sensitive data or expose the system to malicious activity.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the Policy 1206 registry key to 0. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3`
3. Double-click the "Policy 1206" value and change the data to 0.
4. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a group policy object (GPO) to enforce this setting across multiple computers in your network.
* Regularly scan your system for vulnerabilities and install necessary patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic and protect your server from exploitation attempts.

**Note:**

After making these changes, you may need to restart your browser or computer for the changes to take effect.
