**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Enable UseEnhancedPin Policy:**

* Navigate to `Registry Editor (regedit)`
* Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`
* Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `UseEnhancedPin`
* Set its value to `1`

**2. Set Password Strength Requirements (Optional):**

Optional: You can also set additional password strength requirements for the PIN by modifying the `MinimumPINLength` and `MaximumPINLength` values under the same registry key.

**3. Disable Legacy Pin Fallback (Optional):**

Optional: For enhanced security, consider disabling the legacy PIN fallback by setting `LegacyPINFallback` to `0`.

**4. Enforce PIN Complexity:**

* Create a group policy object (GPO)
* Navigate to `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\BitLocker Drive Encryption`
* Enable `Configure TPM Platform and Pin complexity requirements for TPM only`
* Set the `Minimum PIN length` and `Maximum PIN length`

**Impact of Not Fixing the Issue:**

* Weak PINs could allow unauthorized access to encrypted data
* Lack of enhanced PIN protection reduces the overall security of BitLocker encryption

**Note:**

* UseEnhancedPin enables enhanced PIN complexity checks, including minimum length, banned PINs, and character complexity requirements.
* Legacy PIN fallback allows users to enter a simple 4-digit PIN instead of a complex PIN when the TPM is unavailable or compromised.
* Enforcing PIN complexity through GPO provides additional protection against PIN-based attacks.
