**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A8:2021 - Security Configuration Errors

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Check the Expiration Date of the Certificate:**
   - Verify that the notAfter field in the certificate is indeed 2024-12-22 08:00:00 in UTC. If the expiration date is incorrect, you may need to obtain a new certificate.

2. **Update the Server Configuration:**
   - In your Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf), locate the SSLCertificateFile directive. Change the path to the new certificate file that has a valid notAfter date.
   - For example:
   ```
   SSLCertificateFile /path/to/new-certificate.crt
   ```

3. **Restart Apache:**
   - After updating the configuration, restart the Apache service to apply the changes. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```
   systemctl restart apache2
   ```

4. **Verify the Fix:**
   - Use an SSL/TLS scanner to verify that the notAfter field is updated in the new certificate and that the server is properly configured.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Monitor certificate expiration dates regularly to avoid interruptions in service.
- Consider using automated certificate management tools to ensure that certificates are automatically renewed before they expire.
- Implement security headers, such as Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) and Content-Security-Policy (CSP), to prevent browser downgrade attacks that could exploit expired certificates.
