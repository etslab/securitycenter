###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2016-6515
CVE-2016-6515 is a security vulnerability in the Apache web server that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack by sending a long string of characters to the server. The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation in the auth_password function in the auth-passwd.c file.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache web server to a version that includes the security patch for CVE-2016-6515. You can find the latest security patches for Apache web server on the Apache website.

This vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of "Injection." Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated input is passed to a vulnerable component, such as a database query or a web application function. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the application, which can then be executed by the application's users.

To prevent injection vulnerabilities, you should always validate all input before passing it to a vulnerable component. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from attack.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection vulnerabilities:

* Use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with databases.
* Use input validation functions to check for malicious characters before passing input to a web application function.
* Use a WAF to help protect your application from attack.

By following these tips, you can help to prevent injection vulnerabilities and protect your application from attack.
