**Issue Description:**

The `net/http` package in Go allows parsing multipart form data, such as file uploads, using `Request.ParseMultipartForm`. However, if the request contains a large number of fields or files, it can exhaust memory and cause the server to crash.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set a limit on the maximum memory (in bytes) that can be allocated for parsing multipart forms. This can be done using the `MaxMemory` option in `Request.ParseMultipartForm`.

```go
r.ParseMultipartForm(maxMemory *int64) (err error)
```

For example, to set a maximum of 10MB for multipart form parsing:

```go
r.ParseMultipartForm(10 * 1024 * 1024)
```

**Recommendation:**

It is recommended to set a reasonable limit for `MaxMemory` based on the expected size of multipart form requests. This will help prevent memory exhaustion and improve the stability of the server.
