**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Injection

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, disable the `mod_remoteip` module and enable the `mod_headers` module in your Apache server configuration file (e.g., httpd.conf).

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open the Apache configuration file (e.g., /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf).
2. Search for the following lines and comment them out by adding a `#` at the beginning:

```
LoadModule remoteip_module modules/mod_remoteip.so
```

3. Search for the following lines and uncomment them by removing the `#` at the beginning:

```
LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
Header set X-Forwarded-Proto "https" env=HTTPS
```

4. Next, configure the `mod_headers` module to set the `X-Forwarded-For` header:

```
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-For "%{REMOTE_ADDR}i"
```

5. Save and close the configuration file.
6. Restart the Apache server to apply the changes:

```
systemctl restart apache2
```

**Additional Notes:**

* If `mod_remoteip` is required for your application, configure it carefully to prevent remote IP spoofing.
* Instead of setting `X-Forwarded-Proto` to "https" directly, consider using `%{SSL:HTTPS}` to determine the protocol dynamically.
* Regularly update your Apache server to the latest version to patch any potential vulnerabilities.
