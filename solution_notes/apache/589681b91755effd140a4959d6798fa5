**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the `Policy LetAppsActivateWithVoiceAboveLock` registry value to `0`. This will disable the ability for apps to activate with voice above the lock screen.

**Steps to Fix the Issue:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppPrivacy
    ```
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `Policy LetAppsActivateWithVoiceAboveLock`.
4. Set the `Policy LetAppsActivateWithVoiceAboveLock` value to `0`.
5. Close the Registry Editor.

**Impact of the Issue:**

By default, the `Policy LetAppsActivateWithVoiceAboveLock` registry value is set to `1`, which allows apps to activate with voice above the lock screen. This could allow attackers to access sensitive data on a user's device without their knowledge or consent. For example, an attacker could use a voice command to activate a malicious app and then use that app to steal credentials or other sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is related to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Sensitive Data Exposure.
* This issue is not critical because it requires physical access to the device to exploit. However, it is important to fix this issue to protect against potential data breaches.
