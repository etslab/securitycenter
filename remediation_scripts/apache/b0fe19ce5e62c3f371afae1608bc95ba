####patch script to remediate  CVE-2021-40438 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2021-40438 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  apache_version=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is running and the version is less than 2.4.49, then patch the vulnerability
  if [[ $apache_version -lt 2.4.49 ]]; then

    # Download the patch from the Apache website
    wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/src/patches/CVE-2021-40438.patch

    # Apply the patch
    patch -p1 < CVE-2021-40438.patch

    # Restart Apache
    systemctl restart apache2

  fi

fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and the version is less than 2.4.49. If it is, the script will download the patch from the Apache website and apply it. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

It is important to note that this is just a basic patch script. It may not work for all configurations of Apache. If you are unsure about how to apply the patch, please consult the Apache documentation or contact a security professional.
