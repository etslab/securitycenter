###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of immer:1.10.0 of pkg:npm/immer@1.10.0 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
The App Dependencies issue of immer:1.10.0 of pkg:npm/immer@1.10.0 in nginx web server can be fixed by updating the immer package to a newer version. The issue is caused by a security vulnerability in the older version of the package. The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious code into a web request.

To update the immer package, you can use the following command:

```
npm install --save immer@latest
```

This will update the immer package to the latest version, which is 8.0.0 at the time of writing.

The issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of Injection. Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated user input is passed to an interpreter as part of a command or query. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or to modify the behavior of the application.

To prevent injection vulnerabilities, it is important to validate all user input before passing it to an interpreter. This can be done by using a library or framework that provides input validation features, or by manually validating the input yourself.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection vulnerabilities:

* Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL.
* Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation.
* Sanitize all user input before using it in a web request.
* Use input validation libraries or frameworks.
* Educate developers about injection vulnerabilities.

By following these tips, you can help to prevent injection vulnerabilities in your applications.
