###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of utf8-winrar.zip in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the App Dependencies issue of utf8-winrar.zip in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the source of the dependency. This can be done by checking the nginx configuration file for the `root` directive. The `root` directive specifies the directory where nginx will serve files from. If the `root` directive is set to a directory that contains the `utf8-winrar.zip` file, then nginx will try to serve this file to users.
2. Remove the dependency. If the dependency is no longer needed, you can simply remove the `utf8-winrar.zip` file from the directory specified by the `root` directive. If the dependency is still needed, you can move it to a different directory and update the `root` directive to point to the new directory.
3. Restart nginx. Once you have removed or moved the dependency, you need to restart nginx for the changes to take effect.

This issue belongs to the **A1: Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. This category refers to vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into a web application. In the case of the App Dependencies issue, an attacker could inject malicious code into the `utf8-winrar.zip` file. This malicious code could then be executed when a user downloads and extracts the file.

To prevent this type of vulnerability, it is important to keep all dependencies up to date and to only use dependencies from trusted sources. It is also important to validate all user input before processing it.

Here are some additional tips for preventing App Dependencies vulnerabilities:

* Use a dependency management tool to track and manage your dependencies.
* Only use dependencies from trusted sources, such as the official repositories of the project maintainers.
* Keep your dependencies up to date.
* Scan your dependencies for vulnerabilities regularly.
* Validate all user input before processing it.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web application from common attacks.
