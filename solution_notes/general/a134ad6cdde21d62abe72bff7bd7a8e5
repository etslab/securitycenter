4. Set the Value data to the desired maximum size in kilobytes. For example, to set the maximum size to 10MB, enter 10240.
5. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Information:**

* The EventLog service is responsible for managing system logs.
* Policy MaxSize limits the maximum size of the System log file.
* If the System log file grows too large, it can affect the performance of the EventLog service and potentially lead to log truncation.
* Setting an appropriate value for Policy MaxSize ensures that the System log file is not excessively large and that important log events are not lost.
