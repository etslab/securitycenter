**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A03: Injection

**Description:**

The `archive/zip` package in Go does not correctly handle certain ZIP files that contain invalid or overly long file paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious ZIP file that causes the server to consume excessive resources or disclose sensitive information.

**Solution:**

Upgrade to Go version 1.19 or higher, which contains a fix for this issue. Additionally, you can apply the following mitigations:

* **Use a zip validation library:** Use a third-party library such as `github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwa` to validate the ZIP file before extracting its contents.
* **Restrict file path length:** Configure your server to limit the length of file paths that can be processed.
* **Limit resource consumption:** Set limits on the amount of memory and CPU time that the ZIP extraction process can consume.

**How to Fix:**

To upgrade to Go version 1.19 or higher:

```
go install golang.org/dl/go1.19@latest
```

To apply the mitigations:

* **Use a zip validation library:**

```go
import "github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/v2/jwa"

func main() {
    //... Validation logic
    if jwa.ValidateZIP(data) {
        // ... Extract ZIP
    }
}
```

* **Restrict file path length:**

```go
func main() {
    r, err := zip.NewReader(data, maxLength)
    //... Extraction logic
}
```

* **Limit resource consumption:**

```go
func main() {
    r, err := zip.NewReader(data, int64(maxMem), int(maxCPU))
    //... Extraction logic
}
```
