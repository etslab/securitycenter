**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

**1. Update Apache Server:**
- Upgrade to Apache version 2.4.41 or later

**2. Disable the AvoidOriginCheck module (mod_avoidorigincheck):**
- This module allows requests from any origin, which can potentially lead to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) vulnerabilities. It should be disabled for improved security.

**3. Configure CORS Headers:**
- Use the Apache `Header` directive to set appropriate CORS headers, such as:
```
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "https://example.com"
Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
```

**4. Review Web Application Code:**
- Ensure that your web application code is not vulnerable to the origin header being spoofed. Use libraries or frameworks that handle CORS securely.

**5. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
- Implement a WAF to block malicious requests and enforce CORS policies.

**6. Monitor for Exploitation Attempts:**
- Regularly monitor your server for any suspicious activity or exploit attempts related to CVE-2018-14042.
