1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
2. Navigate to the key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`.
3. Right-click on the key and select "Permissions".
4. Under the "Security" tab, add the "Authenticated Users" group and grant it the following permissions:
   - Read
   - Special permissions: "Query Value"
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.
6. Close the Registry Editor.

**Additional Recommendations:**

In addition to the above solution, consider implementing the following hardening measures to further protect the server from this issue:
