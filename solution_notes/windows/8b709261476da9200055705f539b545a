**Severity: High**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Disable Policy Certification Services (PCS) Remote Registry Service:**

* Open Registry Editor (regedit).
* Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.
* Create a new DWORD value named `DisableRPC` and set it to 1.

**OR**

* Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
* Run the following command:
```
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" /v DisableRPC /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

**2. Remove PCS permissions from "Everyone" group:**

* Open Registry Editor.
* Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters`.
* Find the "PolicyAgent" value and double-click it.
* Remove "Everyone" from the list of groups with permissions.
* Save the changes.

**3. Restart the server.**

**Additional Notes:**

* Policy Certification Services (PCS) is a remote registry service that allows users to manage the registry remotely. However, it can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
* Disabling PCS and removing permissions from the "Everyone" group mitigates this risk by preventing unauthorized access to the registry.
