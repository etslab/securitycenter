###How to fix the API Threats issue of Re-examine Cache-control Directives in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the API Threats issue of Re-examine Cache-control Directives in nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the nginx configuration file to make sure that the Cache-Control directives are properly set. The Cache-Control directives control how long a resource is cached by the browser. If the directives are not set correctly, it could allow an attacker to request a resource that has been modified or deleted, or to access a resource that they should not be able to access.
2. Update the nginx configuration file to include the following directives:

```
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

The `max-age` directive specifies the maximum amount of time that a resource can be cached by the browser. The `no-cache` directive tells the browser to check with the server for the latest version of the resource before caching it.

3. Restart the nginx server.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category of Broken Access Control. Broken access control is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to access resources that they should not be able to access. This can be done by exploiting a misconfiguration in the web application or by exploiting a vulnerability in the web application code.

Here are some additional tips for preventing API Threats:

* Use strong authentication for all API requests.
* Use authorization to restrict access to API resources.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.
* Use a WAF to protect against common API attacks.
* Monitor API traffic for suspicious activity.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your API from attack.
