**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Impact:**

Using `os.DirFS` and `http.Dir` with escape sequences on Windows can lead to directory traversal attacks, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files or systems.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, it is recommended to:

1. Validate input paths before accessing them. Ensure that paths do not contain any escape sequences or special characters.
2. Use libraries or frameworks that provide a secure way to handle path traversal, such as `filepath.Clean()` in the Go standard library.
3. Consider implementing input filtering or validation mechanisms to prevent malicious input from reaching your system.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is specific to Windows systems.
* It is important to note that using `os.DirFS` and `http.Dir` is not inherently insecure. The vulnerability arises when these functions are used without proper input validation and sanitization.
* By implementing proper input validation and sanitization, you can mitigate the risk of directory traversal attacks and ensure the security of your application.
