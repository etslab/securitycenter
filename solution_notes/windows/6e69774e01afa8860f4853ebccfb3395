**Solution:**

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor (regedit.exe).

2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile\Logging
```

3. Create a new DWORD value named "Policy LogSuccessfulConnections" if it doesn't exist.

4. Set the value data to 1 to enable logging of successful connections.

5. Restart the Windows Firewall service.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The Policy LogSuccessfulConnections registry value controls whether successful connections to the system are logged by the Windows Firewall. By default, this value is set to 0, which means that successful connections are not logged. This can make it difficult to detect and investigate unauthorized access to the system.

By setting the Policy LogSuccessfulConnections value to 1, the Windows Firewall will log successful connections to the Security event log. This will provide a record of all successful connections, including the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol used, and the port number. This information can be used to detect and investigate unauthorized access to the system.

It is important to note that enabling logging of successful connections can increase the size of the Security event log. Therefore, it is important to monitor the size of the event log and purge old entries as necessary.
