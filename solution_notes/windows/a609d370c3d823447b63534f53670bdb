**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Identity and Access Management

**Solution:**

1. **Verify the Service Principal Name (SPN)**: Ensure that the correct SPN is registered for the application pool identity in Active Directory. The SPN should be in the format `HTTP/<hostname>`.

2. **Grant Access to Registry Keys:** Grant the application pool identity permissions to read and write the following registry keys:

   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions`
   - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit`

3. **Configure Registry Permissions:** Use the following PowerShell command to grant the necessary permissions:

   ```
   Set-Acl -Path <registry_key_path> -User <application_pool_identity> -AccessMask FullControl
   ```

4. **Restart the Web Service:** Restart the application pool or web service to apply the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue occurs when the application pool identity does not have sufficient permissions to access the registry keys required by the website.
* Failure to resolve this issue can result in website access problems or service failures.
