**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - Configure the server to allow cross-site requests from authorized origins. This prevents unauthorized domains from making requests to the server and protects against tapjacking attacks.

2. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement a CSP header to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. This ensures that external resources cannot be loaded into the page and used for tapjacking.

3. **Validate Referrer Header:**
   - Check the HTTP Referrer header to verify that requests are coming from legitimate sources. This helps detect and block requests that originate from malicious domains.

4. **Implement Anti-Clickjacking Measures:**
   - Use the HTML `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) headers to prevent the page from being framed by external websites.
   - Set the `Pointer-Events: none` CSS property on transparent overlays to prevent them from receiving click events.

5. **Disable Pointer Events for Transparent Elements:**
   - Identify any transparent elements or overlays on the page that can be used for tapjacking. Use CSS to disable pointer events for these elements, making them non-interactive.

6. **Regularly Update Software:**
   - Keep the web server and all relevant software up to date with the latest security patches. This includes the Apache web server and any third-party plugins or modules.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Scan the website regularly for vulnerabilities using automated tools.
* Educate users about tapjacking attacks and how to protect themselves.
* Monitor logs and analyze traffic patterns to detect suspicious activity.
