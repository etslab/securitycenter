**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Policy LogSuccessfulConnections registry setting in Windows Firewall PrivateProfile determines whether the firewall logs only dropped packets or both successful and dropped packets. By default, this setting is set to "0", indicating that only dropped packets are logged. This can lead to a lack of visibility into successful connections, which can be used by attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities and target systems.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, the Policy LogSuccessfulConnections registry setting should be changed to "1" to enable logging of both dropped and successful packets. This can be done using the following steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile\Logging`
3. Locate the "LogSuccessfulConnections" DWORD value
4. Double-click the value and change the data to "1"
5. Click OK to save the changes

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting is applicable to both domain controllers and member servers.
* Enabling this setting may increase the size of the firewall log files, so it is recommended to monitor log growth and adjust settings accordingly.
* Audit settings should be reviewed regularly to ensure that only necessary information is being logged.
