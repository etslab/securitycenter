**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to configure your Apache server to prevent the storage of non-storable content. Follow these steps:

1. Edit your Apache configuration file (e.g., `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf` or `/usr/local/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`):

2. Add the following directive to the`<Directory>` section for the affected directory:

```
Options -Indexes
```

3. Restart your Apache server.

**Explanation:**

The `Options -Indexes` directive prevents Apache from generating directory listings for the specified directory. This will help prevent sensitive information from being disclosed to unauthorized users.
