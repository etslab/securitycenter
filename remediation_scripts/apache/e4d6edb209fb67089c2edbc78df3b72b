####patch script to remediate  CVE-2021-26690 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2021-26690 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check the version of Apache
  APACHE_VERSION=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

  # If Apache is vulnerable, upgrade it
  if [[ $APACHE_VERSION -lt 2.4.47 ]]; then
    echo "Upgrading Apache to 2.4.47..."
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y apache2
  fi

  # Restart Apache
  echo "Restarting Apache..."
  sudo service apache2 restart

else

  echo "Apache is not running."

fi
```

This script will check if Apache is running and, if it is, check the version of Apache. If Apache is vulnerable, the script will upgrade Apache to 2.4.47. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

Here are some additional details about the CVE-2021-26690 vulnerability:

* This vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the mod_session module of Apache HTTP Server.
