**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**
The Policy NoNameReleaseOnDemand value in the NetBt registry key controls whether the SMB service should release unauthenticated name connections on demand. A non-zero value indicates that the service should release these connections, which can be exploited by a remote attacker to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by establishing and releasing numerous unauthenticated name connections.

**Solution:**
Set the Policy NoNameReleaseOnDemand value in the NetBt registry key to 0. This will prevent the SMB service from releasing unauthenticated name connections on demand, mitigating the risk of a DoS attack.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters
```
3. In the right pane, locate the Policy NoNameReleaseOnDemand DWORD value.
4. Double-click the DWORD value and set its Value data to 0.
5. Click OK to save the changes.
6. Restart the SMB service.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is not specific to Apache, but it is commonly found in systems running Apache servers.
* It is recommended to keep the SMB service updated with the latest security patches.
* Consider using a firewall to block unauthorized access to the SMB service.
