**Solution:**

To fix the Policy ClearTextPassword issue in Registry System Access in Apache Server, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the Apache Configuration File:**

   - Open the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf).
   - Locate the following directive:
   
      ```conf
      SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
      ```

2. **Add the [NoClearTextPassword] Directive:**

   - Add the following directive immediately after `SSLOptions +StdEnvVars`:

      ```conf
      [NoClearTextPassword]
      ```

3. **Restart Apache:**

   - Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

**Explanation:**

The Policy ClearTextPassword issue arises when an Apache server is configured to allow the transmission of plain text passwords over HTTP. This poses a security risk as passwords can be intercepted and used to gain unauthorized access to the server.

By adding the `[NoClearTextPassword]` directive, you instruct Apache to disallow clear text passwords and require that sensitive information be transmitted securely using encrypted protocols like SSL/TLS.

This configuration change strengthens the security of your Apache server and mitigates the risk associated with the Policy ClearTextPassword issue.
