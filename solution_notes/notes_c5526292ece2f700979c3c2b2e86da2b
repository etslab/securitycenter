**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Configure Secure Registry Settings:**
   - Open the "Registry Editor" (Regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa".
   - Create or modify the following DWORD values:
     - "DisableDomainCreds": Set to 1 to disable saving domain credentials in the registry.
     - "DisableRegistryLogonFixedOrder": Set to 1 to prevent predictable order of registry keys being checked for cached credentials.

2. **Disable IPsec Quick Mode:**
   - Open the "Local Security Policy" console (secpol.msc).
   - Navigate to "IP Security Policies on Local Computer\IP Security Monitoring Properties".
   - Uncheck the "Log IPsec Quick Mode Security" option.

3. **Remove Cached Credentials:**
   - Run the following command as an administrator:
     - `reg delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GINA" /v "DefaultPassword" /f`

**Note:**

* This issue can expose sensitive information such as usernames and passwords stored in the registry during logon/logoff processes.
* Disabling IPsec Quick Mode logging prevents the creation of additional registry keys containing cached credentials.
* Regularly reviewing and cleaning up cached credentials is recommended to mitigate the risk of sensitive data exposure.
