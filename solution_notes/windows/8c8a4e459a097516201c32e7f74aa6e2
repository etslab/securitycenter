**Severity: High**

This issue allows unauthorized users to manage other accounts in the registry, potentially compromising sensitive data and system stability.

**Solution:**

1. **Review Registry Permissions:** Ensure that only authorized administrators have write permissions to critical registry keys and values.
2. **Implement Account Control:** Use Group Policy or local policies to restrict user access to the registry based on job roles and responsibilities.
3. **Consider Least Privilege:** Assign users only the minimum level of permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
4. **Audit Registry Changes:** Enable registry auditing to track changes and identify unauthorized access or modifications.
