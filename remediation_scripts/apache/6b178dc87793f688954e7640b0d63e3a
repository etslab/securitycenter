####patch script to remediate  CVE-2022-23943 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is the patch script to remediate CVE-2022-23943 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check the version of Apache
version=$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}')

# If Apache is 2.4.52 or older, then apply the patch
if [[ $version -lt 2.4.53 ]]; then
  echo "Applying patch for CVE-2022-23943."
  patch -p1 < CVE-2022-23943.patch
fi

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache."
apache2ctl restart

# Check if the patch was applied successfully
if ! grep -q "CVE-2022-23943" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "Patch was not applied successfully."
  exit 1
fi

echo "Patch applied successfully."
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and running. If it is, the script will check the version of Apache. If Apache is 2.4.52 or older, then the script will apply the patch for CVE-2022-23943. Finally, the script will restart Apache and check if the patch was applied successfully.
