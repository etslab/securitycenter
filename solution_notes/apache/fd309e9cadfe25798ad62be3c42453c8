**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Enable IAM for Registry Authentication:**
   - Go to Google Cloud console and navigate to `Registry` -> `Authentication`.
   - Select "Enable IAM based authentication" and click "Save".

2. **Create a Service Account:**
   - Go to Cloud IAM console and create a service account for the registry user.
   - Assign the `cloudstorage.admin` and `storage.admin` roles to the service account.

3. **Grant Access to Service Account:**
   - Navigate to the registry and click "Permissions".
   - Add the service account as a user with the "Editor" role.

4. **Disable Anonymous Access:**
   - Go to Cloud Storage console and navigate to the bucket associated with the registry.
   - Click "Permissions" and remove any public or anonymous access.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use fine-grained IAM roles to grant only the necessary permissions to users.
* Regularly review and revoke access to unused service accounts.
* Implement logging and monitoring to detect any suspicious activity.

By implementing these steps, you can restrict access to the registry and secure the stored images from unauthorized users.
