**Steps to fix CVE-2011-1473 in nginx:**

1. Upgrade to nginx version 1.0.10 or higher.
2. Restart nginx.

**Additional steps to mitigate the risk of Broken Authentication:**

* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for all administrative accounts.
* Implement a CAPTCHA or other challenge-response mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.
* Monitor your nginx logs for suspicious activity.

If you are unable to upgrade to nginx version 1.0.10 or higher, you can apply the following workaround:

1. Open the nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`).
2. Add the following lines to the `http` block:

```
auth_basic "Restricted Area";
auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
```

3. Create a password file for nginx using the following command:

```
htpasswd -b /etc/nginx/.htpasswd username password
```

4. Restart nginx.

**Note:** This workaround is not a complete solution and should only be used until you are able to upgrade to nginx version 1.0.10 or higher.
