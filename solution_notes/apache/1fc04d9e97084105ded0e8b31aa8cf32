###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Cookie Without Secure Flag
The following are the steps to fix the Web Threats issue of Cookie Without Secure Flag in Apache web server:

1. Enable the `mod_headers` module in Apache.
2. Add the following line to the `httpd.conf` file:

```
Header set Set-Cookie HttpOnly;Secure
```

3. Restart Apache.

This will ensure that all cookies set by Apache will have the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags set. The `HttpOnly` flag prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie, and the `Secure` flag prevents the cookie from being sent over HTTP connections.

This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks 2021 category of **A1: Injection**. Injection flaws, such as XSS, can be used to steal cookies and hijack user sessions. By setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on cookies, you can help to mitigate the risk of these attacks.

In addition to setting the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags, you should also take other steps to secure your web application, such as:

* Using strong passwords and password hashing
* Implementing input validation
* Keeping your software up to date
* Using a web application firewall (WAF)

By taking these steps, you can help to protect your web application from attack.
