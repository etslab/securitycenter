**Description:**

The presence of apktool_out/lib/x86_64/libbuffer_pg.so in the Apache server indicates that the server has been compromised by a malicious actor. This file is a shared library that is typically used by Android applications. Its presence in a web server is suspicious and suggests that the attacker may have gained access to sensitive information or may have planted malware on the server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Scan your server for malware and remove any malicious files that are found.
2. Check your server logs for any suspicious activity and block any unauthorized IPs.
3. Update your Apache server to the latest version.
4. Configure your server to block access to unnecessary directories and files, including apktool_out.
5. Review your server's security settings and make sure they are configured appropriately.
6. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests and protect your server from further attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to act quickly to resolve this issue as it poses a significant security risk to your server and the data it contains.
* Consider hiring a security expert to assist with the investigation and remediation process if necessary.
