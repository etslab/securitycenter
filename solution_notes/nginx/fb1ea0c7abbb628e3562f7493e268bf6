The cli-64.exe App Dependencies issue belongs to the **Injection** category of the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021. Injection attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. This code can then be executed by the web application, giving the attacker control over the application.

The cli-64.exe App Dependencies issue is a specific example of an injection attack. In this case, the attacker is injecting malicious code into the nginx web server's configuration file. This code can then be executed by the web server, giving the attacker control over the web server.

To protect against injection attacks, it is important to validate all user input before using it in any way. This includes validating input that is used in web application configuration files.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection attacks:

* Use prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This will help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the query.
* Use input validation to ensure that all user input is valid before using it in any way.
* Escape any user input that is output to the web page. This will help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into the web page.
* Keep your web applications up to date with the latest security patches.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
