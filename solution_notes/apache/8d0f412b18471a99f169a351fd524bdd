**Assessment Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To resolve the excessive memory growth issue, you can implement the following:

1. **Upgrade Apache Server to Version 2.4.48 or Higher:** Apache versions prior to 2.4.48 are known to have this memory growth issue. Upgrade to a supported version of Apache.

2. **Enable HTTP/2 Push Only When Necessary:** HTTP/2 push can lead to excessive memory consumption in certain scenarios. Only enable push if it is essential for your application's performance.

3. **Limit the Number of Concurrent HTTP/2 Connections:** Set a limit on the maximum number of concurrent HTTP/2 connections allowed per client. This will prevent excessive memory usage by a single client.

4. **Configure HTTP/2 Timeout Settings:** Adjust the HTTP/2 connection timeout settings to prevent idle connections from consuming memory.

5. **Monitor Memory Usage Regularly:** Implement monitoring tools to track memory usage and detect any potential issues early on.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a reverse proxy, such as Nginx or H2O, in front of your Go server to handle HTTP/2 requests. This can help mitigate memory issues in the Go server.
* Regularly review and update all server configurations and dependencies. This includes the Go runtime, Apache server settings, and any related libraries or modules.

**Impact on OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:**

This issue does not directly fall under the Sensitive Data Exposure category of OWASP Top 10 2021. However, excessive memory consumption can potentially lead to system instability and may create an opportunity for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities that could result in sensitive data exposure.
