###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2019-10097
CVE-2019-10097 is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server's mod_remoteip module. This vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system if the mod_remoteip module is configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache HTTP Server to a version that is not affected by this vulnerability. You can find a list of affected versions on the Apache HTTP Server website.

This vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of "Injection". Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated or malicious input is injected into an application, resulting in unintended behavior. Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, steal sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality.

Here are some additional steps you can take to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out malicious traffic.
* Implement input validation and filtering to prevent unvalidated or malicious input from being injected into the application.
* Monitor your application for signs of attack, such as unusual traffic patterns or changes in application behavior.

By following these steps, you can help to protect your Apache HTTP Server from the CVE-2019-10097 vulnerability and other injection vulnerabilities.
