**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

**1. Remove the Vulnerable Code:**
- Remove all code that uses the android_aes_ecb encryption algorithm.
- Replace it with a secure encryption algorithm, such as AES in CBC mode.

**2. Update Libraries:**
- Update any libraries that may be using android_aes_ecb.
- Ensure that the updated libraries use secure encryption algorithms.

**3. Test and Verify:**
- Thoroughly test your application to ensure that no vulnerable code remains.
- Verify that all data is encrypted using a secure algorithm.

**Additional Notes:**

* Android_aes_ecb is an insecure encryption algorithm that is vulnerable to attack.
* It uses Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode, which does not provide sufficient data confidentiality.
* Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and credit card numbers.
* It is critical to remove all vulnerable code and update your application to use secure encryption algorithms.
