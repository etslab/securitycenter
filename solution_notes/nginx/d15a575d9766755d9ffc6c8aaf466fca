There are a few things you can do to fix the issue of your Nginx web server not redirecting to an HTTPS site.

1. **Check your Nginx configuration file.** Make sure that you have a valid SSL certificate installed and that the correct directives are in place to redirect all traffic to HTTPS.
2. **Check your firewall settings.** Make sure that your firewall is configured to allow traffic on port 443 (the HTTPS port).
3. **Check your DNS settings.** Make sure that your DNS records are configured correctly and that your domain name points to the correct IP address for your web server.

If you have checked all of these things and you are still having problems, you can try contacting your hosting provider for assistance.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is **A1: Injection**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into web applications. One way that attackers can inject malicious code is by exploiting a misconfiguration that allows them to bypass the HTTPS redirect.

To avoid this vulnerability, it is important to make sure that your Nginx web server is properly configured to redirect all traffic to HTTPS. You can also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your web application from injection attacks.

Here are some additional tips for securing your Nginx web server:

* Use a strong password for your web server.
* Keep your Nginx software up to date.
* Use a WAF to help protect your web application from attacks.
* Monitor your Nginx web server for signs of trouble.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your Nginx web server secure and prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.
