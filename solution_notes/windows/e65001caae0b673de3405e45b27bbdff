**Severity**: High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category**: A6: Security Misconfiguration

**Issue**: The DefaultOutboundAction policy in the Windows Firewall Domain Profile is not set to "Block". This allows unauthorized outbound connections, which could lead to data exfiltration or other security breaches.

**Solution**:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile`
3. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `DefaultOutboundAction` if it does not exist.
4. Set the value of `DefaultOutboundAction` to `1`.
5. Restart the computer to apply the changes.

**Additional Notes**:

* The DefaultOutboundAction policy can be set to one of the following values:
    * 0: Allow
    * 1: Block
    * 2: Not configured (default)
* It is recommended to set the DefaultOutboundAction policy to "Block" to prevent unauthorized outbound connections.
* This issue can be identified using a registry scanner or by manually inspecting the Windows Firewall settings.
