**Severity:** Critical

**Detailed Solution:**

To fix CVE-2007-3205, you need to update your Apache server to version 2.2.4 or later. This vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the mod_ssl module, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Here are the steps to update your Apache server:

1. Download the latest version of Apache from the Apache website ([httpd.apache.org](https://httpd.apache.org/)).
2. Stop your Apache server.
3. Unpack the downloaded Apache archive.
4. Copy the new Apache files over your existing Apache installation.
5. Start your Apache server.

After updating your Apache server, you should also verify that the mod_ssl module is disabled. To do this, edit the Apache configuration file (usually located at /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) and find the line that loads the mod_ssl module. Comment out this line by adding a # character at the beginning of the line.

For example:

```
#LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
```

Once you have made these changes, restart your Apache server to apply the new configuration.

**Additional Mitigation:**

In addition to updating your Apache server, you can also take the following steps to mitigate this vulnerability:

* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic.
* Implement input validation and filtering to prevent attackers from submitting malicious data to your web application.
* Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect your server from unauthorized access.
