####patch script to remediate  Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely. This includes unsafe-inline or data: inside script-src overly broad sources such as https: inside object-src or script-src or not restricting the sources for object-src or script-src. in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here are the steps on how to patch a script to remediate Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented unsafely in Apache HTTP Server:

1. Open the Apache configuration file. The default location of this file is `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
2. Locate the section that defines the CSP policy. This section will typically start with the following line:

```
<ContentSecurityPolicy>
```

3. Review the CSP policy and make sure that it does not include any of the following unsafe features:

    * `unsafe-inline` or `data:` inside `script-src`
    * Overly broad sources such as `https:` inside `object-src` or `script-src`
    * Not restricting the sources for `object-src` or `script-src`

4. If any of the unsafe features are present, remove them from the CSP policy.
5. Save the Apache configuration file.
6. Restart the Apache web server.

Once you have completed these steps, the CSP policy will be remediated and your website will be more secure.

Here are some additional tips for securing your website with CSP:

* Use a strong CSP policy that includes a wide variety of sources. This will help to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into your website.
* Update your CSP policy regularly to reflect changes in the threat landscape.
* Use a CSP auditor to help you identify and fix any vulnerabilities in your CSP policy.

By following these tips, you can help to keep your website safe from attack.
