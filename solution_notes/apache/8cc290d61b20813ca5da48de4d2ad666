###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Vulnerable JS Library
There are a few ways to fix the Web Threats issue of Vulnerable JS Library in Apache web server.

* **Update the JS library to the latest version.** This is the most effective way to fix the issue, as it will patch any known vulnerabilities.
* **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve the JS library.** A CDN will cache the JS library on servers that are closer to your users, which will improve performance and make it more difficult for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block known attack vectors.** A WAF can be configured to block requests that are known to exploit JS vulnerabilities.

The Vulnerable JS Library issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Security Risks 2021 category of **A1 - Injection**. Injection attacks are a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. This malicious code can then be executed by the web application, which can allow the attacker to gain access to the application or its data.

Here are some additional tips for preventing Vulnerable JS Library attacks:

* **Use a secure coding methodology.** A secure coding methodology will help you to write code that is less vulnerable to attack.
* **Scan your code for vulnerabilities.** There are a number of tools available that can scan your code for vulnerabilities.
* **Educate your developers about security risks.** Make sure that your developers are aware of the security risks associated with JS libraries and how to prevent them.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web application from Vulnerable JS Library attacks.
