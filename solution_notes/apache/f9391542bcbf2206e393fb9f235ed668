## Severity

Medium

## Description

The function `checkToken()` in the file `dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php` checks whether a token is present in the request and whether it is valid. The token is generated in the function `generateToken()`, which uses the function `randomString()` to generate a random string. The function `randomString()` is not cryptographically secure, which means that it is possible for an attacker to guess the token and bypass the check.

## OWASP Top 10 2021 Category

Broken Access Control

## Solution

To fix this issue, the function `generateToken()` should be modified to use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). For example, the following code could be used:

```php
function generateToken() {
  return bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
}
```

## Additional Notes

This issue is related to the OWASP Top 10 2021 category "Broken Access Control" because it allows an attacker to bypass the intended access control mechanism (the token check) and gain access to unauthorized resources.
