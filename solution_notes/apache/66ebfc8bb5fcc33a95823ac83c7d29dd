**Solution:**

1. **Enable Windows File Protection (WFP):** WFP protects system files from unauthorized modification.
   - Open "Windows Security" and go to "Device security" > "Security processor details" > "Core isolation details".
   - Turn on "Memory integrity".

2. **Configure Registry Permissions:**
   - Open "Registry Editor" (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`.
   - Right-click on "Lsa" and select "Permissions".
   - Remove "Everyone" group from the list if it exists.
   - Add the "Administrators" group with "Full Control" permissions.

3. **Use Strong Registry Hive Permissions:**
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM`.
   - Right-click on each subkey (e.g., MountedDevices, Select, Setup) and select "Permissions".
   - Remove "Everyone" and "Users" groups.
   - Add the "Administrators" group with "Full Control" permissions.

4. **Disable Registry Editing via GPO:**
   - Open "Group Policy Management Editor" (gpedit.msc).
   - Go to "Computer Configuration" > "Policies" > "Administrative Templates" > "System" > "Registry".
   - Enable "Prevent access to registry editing tools" policy.

5. **Monitor Registry Changes:**
   - Use tools like Sysmon or Windows Event Viewer to monitor for suspicious registry modifications.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Keep the server updated with the latest security patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests and protect sensitive data.
* Implement regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
