**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Authentication Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, set the `'allow_users'` option in the `'settings.php'` file to `false`. This will disable user registration and prevent unauthorized access to the admin panel.

**Modified code:**

```php
<?php
// Allow user registration?
$allow_users = false;
?>
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly review and update your code to address security vulnerabilities.
* Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive information and functionality based on user roles and permissions.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your web applications from malicious traffic and attacks.
