####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Server Leaks Information via X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field(s) in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Server Leaks Information via X-Powered-By HTTP Response Header Field(s) in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [[ $(ps -ef | grep -c httpd) -gt 0 ]]; then

  # Get the current Apache configuration file
  conf_file=$(apachectl -V | grep -Po "conf\s+(.*?)\.conf")

  # Check if the X-Powered-By header is enabled
  if grep -q "X-Powered-By" $conf_file; then

    # Disable the X-Powered-By header
    sed -i "s/X-Powered-By.*//" $conf_file

    # Restart Apache
    apachectl restart

    echo "Successfully patched CVE-2013-0169."
  else

    echo "X-Powered-By header is not enabled. No action required."
  fi

else

  echo "Apache is not running. No action required."
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will get the current Apache configuration file and check if the X-Powered-By header is enabled. If it is, the script will disable the header and restart Apache. If the header is not enabled, the script will print a message stating that no action is required.
