**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to the following registry key:
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters`
3. In the right pane, double-click the `RequireSignOrSeal` value.
4. Set the value to `1`.
5. Click `OK`.
6. Close the Registry Editor.

**Explanation:**

The `RequireSignOrSeal` registry value specifies whether the Netlogon service requires all incoming or outgoing Netlogon RPCs to be signed and sealed. Setting this value to `1` ensures that all Netlogon traffic is authenticated and encrypted, which helps to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Note:** Setting this value to `1` may have a performance impact, especially on large networks. It is recommended to test this setting in a non-production environment before implementing it in a production environment.
