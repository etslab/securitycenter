**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Review and Restrict Foreground Service Permissions:**
   - Determine which services require foreground permissions and restrict it to only those that genuinely need it.
   - Use the `<service>` element in the AndroidManifest.xml to declare foreground services with the `android:foregroundServiceType` attribute.

2. **Use Explicit Intent for Foreground Service:**
   - When starting a foreground service, use an explicit intent to specify the service class directly.
   - Avoid using implicit intents as they can be intercepted by malicious apps.

3. **Declare Foreground Service Notifications:**
   - For each foreground service, declare a notification in the `<service>` element with a persistent notification channel.
   - This notification should provide clear information about the service's purpose and allow users to control it.

4. **Set Notification Visibility:**
   - Specify the visibility of the service's notification using the `android:visibility` attribute within the `<notification>` element.
   - Set it to "public" to make it visible in the notification bar or "secret" to hide it from the user interface.

5. **Consider Alternatives to Foreground Services:**
   - Explore alternative ways to perform tasks if they do not require foreground permissions.
   - Consider using scheduled jobs, WorkManager, or fenced broadcast receivers instead.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Regularly review and update the permissions required by your application.
- Implement proper input validation and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- Use code obfuscation and other techniques to protect your application from reverse engineering and tampering.
