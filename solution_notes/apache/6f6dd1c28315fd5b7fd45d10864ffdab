**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Vulnerable Library:** The issue originates from the libbuffer_pg.so library within the apktool_out/lib/x86 directory.

2. **Restrict Access to the Library:**

   - **Android Studio:** In the project's build.gradle file, add the following code to the dependencies section:
     ```
     packagingOptions {
       excludes += ['**/lib/x86/libbuffer_pg.so']
     }
     ```

   - **Gradle Plugin:** Use the `packagingOptions` block in the `app/build.gradle` file:
     ```
     android {
       packagingOptions {
         excludes += ['**/lib/x86/libbuffer_pg.so']
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Update Apache:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of Apache HTTP Server.

4. **Configure Apache:** In the Apache configuration file, restrict access to the libbuffer_pg.so library using the following directives:

   - **<Directory "/path/to/apktool_out/lib/x86">**
   - **Options Indexes FollowSymLinks**
   - **AllowOverride None**
   - **Deny from all**
   - **</Directory>**

5. **Run `adb logcat`:** After implementing these changes, run `adb logcat` to verify that access to libbuffer_pg.so is blocked.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue allows attackers to access sensitive data stored in the database if the application has access to the database.
* The `libbuffer_pg.so` library is used by Android applications to connect to PostgreSQL databases. By restricting access to this library, you can prevent unauthorized access to the database.
* It is important to regularly update your Apache HTTP Server and software dependencies to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
