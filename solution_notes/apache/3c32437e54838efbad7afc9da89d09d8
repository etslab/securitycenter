###How to fix the Certificates issue of cert expirationStatus, expires < 60 days (47)
To fix the Certificates issue of cert expirationStatus, expires < 60 days (47) in Apache web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Check the expiration date of your SSL certificate. You can do this by using the following command:

```
openssl x509 -in <path-to-certificate> -text | grep "Not After"
```

The output of this command will show you the expiration date of your certificate.

2. If the expiration date is less than 60 days away, you will need to renew your certificate. You can do this by contacting your certificate authority (CA).

3. Once you have renewed your certificate, you will need to update it in Apache. You can do this by editing the following file:

```
/etc/apache2/sites-available/default
```

Find the following line:

```
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/<path-to-certificate>
```

and replace the path to the certificate with the path to the new certificate.

4. Restart Apache. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

Once you have completed these steps, the error should be fixed.
