**Detailed Solution:**

1. Review the server configuration to identify any unnecessary connections to third-party services in OFAC-sanctioned countries.
2. Implement certificate pinning to ensure that the server only trusts certificates from a specific set of known authorities.
3. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block traffic from OFAC-sanctioned countries.
4. Regularly review and update the list of OFAC-sanctioned countries to ensure that the controls are up-to-date.

**Additional Measures:**

* Enable SSL/TLS encryption for all connections to and from the server.
* Implement content security policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load content.
* Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify any vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to bypass security controls.
