**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A2 - Broken Authentication

**Solution:**

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Edit the Apache configuration file:**
   - Locate the `httpd.conf` file for your Apache web server installation.
   - Add the following directive to the `SSL` section of the file:

   ```
   SSLSessionTickets Off
   ```

2. **Restart the Apache server:**
   - Restart the Apache web server to apply the changes and disable session tickets.

**Additional Notes:**

* Session tickets are small tokens issued by the server to identify clients and resume TLS sessions more efficiently.
* Adding a random value to the ticket age (ticket_age_add) prevents attackers from predicting the age of a ticket and potentially reusing it for malicious purposes.
* Disabling session tickets entirely is a good practice to enhance security, but it may slightly impact performance in high-traffic environments.
