**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to enable the Policy SignSecureChannel setting in the Registry. Here are the steps:

1. Open **Registry Editor** (Regedit.exe) on the affected server.
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
   ```
3. In the right pane, locate the **Policy SignSecureChannel** DWORD value.
4. Double-click on the value and change the data value to **1** to enable signing.
5. Click **OK** to save the change.
6. Restart the **Netlogon** service.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting ensures that the Netlogon service uses secure channels for communication, protecting passwords and other sensitive information from eavesdropping.
* The default value for this setting is 0 (disabled), which can expose sensitive data to attackers.
* Enabling this setting adds an additional layer of security to protect against password theft and other attacks.
