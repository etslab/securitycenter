**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

**1. Disable Policy Special Logon in Registry:**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit).
* Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.
* Create a new DWORD value named "DisablePolicySpecialLogon" and set its value to 1.

**2. Disable Logon/Logoff Logging:**

* Open the Event Viewer (eventvwr).
* Expand Windows Logs -> Security.
* Right-click "Logon/Logoff" and select "Properties".
* Uncheck "Enable logging" and click "OK".

**3. Disable Audit Policy Special Logon:**

* Open Local Security Policy (secpol.msc).
* Go to Local Policies -> Audit Policy.
* Double-click "Audit logon" and clear the "Success" and "Failure" checkboxes.

**4. Restart the Server:**

* Restart the server to apply the changes.

**Additional Notes:**

* Policy Special Logon is used by attackers to gain privileged access by creating a registry key that allows them to bypass normal logon restrictions.
* Disabling logon/logoff logging prevents attackers from obtaining sensitive information about user logons and logoffs.
* Disabling audit policy special logon prevents auditing of special logon events, which can reduce the risk of attackers exploiting this vulnerability.
