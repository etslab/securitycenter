**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The Policy DisableExceptionChainValidation registry setting in the Kernel section of the System Registry determines whether the system will enforce access control checks on exception chains. If this setting is disabled, attackers can bypass access control mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to sensitive system resources.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Kernel
    ```
3. Locate the "DisableExceptionChainValidation" DWORD value.
4. Set the value data to "0".
5. Click OK to save the changes.
6. Restart the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting is used by the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) to enforce access control on exception chains. An exception chain is a series of exception handlers that are invoked when an exception occurs.
* If this setting is disabled, attackers can use techniques such as SEH (Structured Exception Handling) overwrites to overwrite the exception handler stack and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
* It is strongly recommended to enable this setting to help prevent the exploitation of vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access or code execution.
