**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. Open the registry editor (regedit.exe).

2. Navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Restrictions
```

3. Delete the following registry value:

```
DenyDeviceClasses
```

4. Close the registry editor.

**Explanation:**

The `DenyDeviceClasses` registry value is used to specify a list of device classes that are blocked from being installed on the system. If this registry value is set, users will not be able to install any devices that belong to the specified device classes.

This issue is considered high severity because it could allow a malicious actor to block the installation of critical devices, such as security updates or antivirus software. This could compromise the security of the system and make it vulnerable to attack.

It falls under the OWASP Top 10 2021 category of Broken Access Control because it allows an unauthorized user to modify the registry and prevent the installation of devices.
