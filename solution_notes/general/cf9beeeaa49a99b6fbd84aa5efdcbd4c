**Severity:** High

**Solution:**

The vendor has released a patch to address this issue. It is recommended to update to the latest version of zlib.

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Detailed Explanation:**

This vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow caused by an integer overflow in the zipOpenNewFileInZip4_6 function in zlib. When creating a new ZIP archive, the function can be tricked into allocating a buffer that is too small, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

The patch released by the vendor fixes the integer overflow by using a different data type for the buffer size calculation. This ensures that the buffer is always allocated with the correct size, preventing the heap-based buffer overflow from occurring.

**Recommendations:**

* Update to the latest version of zlib.
* Scan your systems for any outdated versions of zlib and update them immediately.
* Implement security measures to prevent attackers from exploiting this vulnerability, such as input validation and sanitization.
* Monitor your systems for any suspicious activity and take appropriate action as needed.
