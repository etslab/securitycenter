In addition to upgrading Nginx, you should also take the following steps to mitigate the CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability:

* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) on your Nginx server. This will help to prevent attackers from downgrading your connection to HTTP, which is required to exploit the CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability.
* Disable HTTP compression on your Nginx server. This will remove the attack vector for the CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect your Nginx server from attacks. A WAF can be used to block malicious requests, including those that attempt to exploit the CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability.

CVE-2013-3587 belongs to the following OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category:

* **A1: Injection**

This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to inject malicious code into web applications. The CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability can be exploited to inject malicious code into web applications, which can then be used to steal sensitive information or take control of the web application.

To protect your Nginx web server from the CVE-2013-3587 vulnerability, it is important to upgrade to a patched version of Nginx and to take the other mitigation steps described above.
