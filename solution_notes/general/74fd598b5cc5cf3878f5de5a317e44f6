**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

The android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION permission is required by apps that want to access advertising identifiers. If an unauthorized party gains access to this permission, they could potentially track user activity and behavior.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you can remove the android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION permission from the AndroidManifest.xml file. You should also ensure that your app does not use any libraries or SDKs that require this permission.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file in your project.
2. Locate the <uses-permission> tag that grants the android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION permission.
3. Delete the <uses-permission> tag.
4. Save the AndroidManifest.xml file.
5. Rebuild and deploy your app.

**Additional Notes:**

* If you are using a third-party library or SDK that requires the android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_ATTRIBUTION permission, you may need to contact the vendor for a solution.
* You should also consider implementing other measures to protect user privacy, such as using encryption and anonymizing data.
