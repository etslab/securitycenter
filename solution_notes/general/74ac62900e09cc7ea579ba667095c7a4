**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Description:**

The `VideoPlayerActivity` activity in the `io.awesome.gagtube.download.ui.player` package is exported, meaning it can be accessed by any application or component. This exposes sensitive data such as user information and media playback history to unauthorized parties.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file in your project.
2. Locate the `<activity>` element for the `VideoPlayerActivity`.
3. Add the following attribute to the `<activity>` element:

```xml
android:exported="false"
```

This will prevent the activity from being exported, making it accessible only to the application components that need to use it.

**Impact:**

Leaving this activity exported exposes sensitive user data to potential attackers. This could lead to privacy violations, identity theft, and other security risks.
