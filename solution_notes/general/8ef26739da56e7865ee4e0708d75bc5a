**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The bWAPP website is vulnerable to an authorization bypass via directory traversal. This vulnerability arises when the application allows user-controlled input to directly access files or directories outside of the intended root directory. An attacker could exploit this to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Review the Code:** Carefully examine the code that handles user input and directory traversal functionality.
2. **Sanitize Input:** Implement strong input sanitization techniques to ensure that user-provided input is validated and filtered before being used in file path operations.
3. **Use Whitelists:** Implement whitelists of allowed directories and files to limit the scope of what users can access.
4. **Set Proper File Permissions:** Ensure that files and directories have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Use Secure Code Libraries:** Consider using well-tested security libraries that provide pre-built and secure directory traversal functionality.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly test your application for vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual penetration testing.
* Implement security monitoring and logging to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.
* Restrict access to sensitive directories and files to authorized users only.
