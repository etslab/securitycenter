**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Issue Description:**

The `html/template` package in Go allows custom types to define their own `MarshalJSON` method. If this method returns an error, the template escaping mechanism may be broken, potentially leading to an injection vulnerability.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, ensure that custom types implement the `MarshalJSON` method correctly and never return an error. If an error occurs during marshaling, the template should be executed without the custom type's value.

**Implementation:**

```go
type MyType struct {
    // ...
}

func (t MyType) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
    // Implement MarshalJSON correctly

    // In case of an error, return nil without an error
    if err != nil {
        return nil, nil
    }

    // Marshal using json.Marshal or similar
    return json.Marshal(t)
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue is not specific to Apache servers but can affect any application using the `html/template` package.
* The severity is rated as medium because it can lead to an injection vulnerability, but it is less likely to occur than other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
* To mitigate the risk, ensure that all custom types used in templates implement the `MarshalJSON` method securely.
