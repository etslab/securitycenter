####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2019-0217 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-3587, CWE-310 CVE-2019-0217 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version is installed
if ! [ "$(apache2 -V | awk '{print $3}')" -ge 2.4.12 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not vulnerable"
  exit 0
fi

# Patch the vulnerable files
for file in $(apache2 -V | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/,//g'); do
  echo "Patching $file"
  sed -i.bak "s/AcceptPathInfo On/AcceptPathInfo Off/g" $file
done

# Restart Apache
echo "Restarting Apache"
apache2ctl restart
```

This script will check if Apache is installed and if the vulnerable version is installed. If it is, the script will patch the vulnerable files and restart Apache.

Here are some additional details about the vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2013-3587 is a remote code execution vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a specially crafted request.
* CWE-310 is a software design flaw that can lead to security vulnerabilities. In the case of Apache HTTP Server, CWE-310 can be exploited to allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the server.
* CVE-2019-0217 is a denial-of-service vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to crash the server by sending a specially crafted request.
