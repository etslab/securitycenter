**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Server Misconfiguration

**Detailed Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry path:

   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Power\PowerSettings\abfc251936084c2a94ea171b0ed546ab
   ```

2. Right-click on the "ACSettingIndex" value and select "Delete".

3. Close the Registry Editor and restart the apache server.

**Explanation:**

The ACSettingIndex registry setting is used to control the power settings for the Apache server. By default, this setting is set to 0, which disables any power-saving features. However, if this setting is set to a non-zero value, it can enable power-saving features that could potentially interfere with the normal operation of the server.

By deleting the ACSettingIndex registry setting, you can ensure that the server is not using any power-saving features that could affect its performance.
