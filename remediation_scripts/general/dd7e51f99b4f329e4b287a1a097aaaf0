####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 X-Frame-Options (XFO) header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 X-Frame-Options (XFO) header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /etc/init.d/apache2 ]; then
  service apache2 status | grep -q running
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Apache is running."
  else
    echo "Apache is not running. Please start it before applying the patch."
    exit 1
  fi
else
  echo "Apache is not installed. Please install it before applying the patch."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the X-Frame-Options header is already enabled
grep -q X-Frame-Options /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "The X-Frame-Options header is already enabled. No further action is required."
  exit 0
fi

# Add the following line to /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
# X-Frame-Options: DENY

# Save the file and restart Apache
service apache2 restart

# Check that the X-Frame-Options header is now enabled
grep -q X-Frame-Options /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "The X-Frame-Options header has been enabled successfully."
else
  echo "The X-Frame-Options header could not be enabled. Please check the configuration file."
  exit 1
fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is running and if the X-Frame-Options header is already enabled. If the header is not enabled, the script will add it to the Apache configuration file and restart Apache. The script will then check that the header is now enabled.
