**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

**1. Secure Caching Headers:**

* **Cache-Control:** Set to "private" or "no-store" to prevent caching by proxies.
* **Pragma:** Set to "no-cache" to disable HTTP/1.0 caching.
* **Expires:** Set to a date in the past to expire the cached content immediately.

**2. Disable ETags:**

* Disable ETags by setting the `ETag` header to the empty string. This prevents browsers from identifying and reusing cached content.

**3. Limit Cache Validity Period:**

* Set a short cache validity period (e.g., a few minutes or hours) to prevent outdated or sensitive content from being stored in caches.

**4. Use Secure Cookies:**

* Use the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` cookie flags to prevent attacks that leverage cached cookies.

**5. Access Control:**

* Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive content and prevent unauthorized disclosure.
* Use authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access storable or cacheable content.

**6. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

* Implement a CSP to define trusted sources for loading resources, mitigating cross-site caching attacks.

**7. Disable Unnecessary Browser Caching:**

* Disable unnecessary browser caching by setting the `Cache-Control` header for specific resources to "no-cache."

**8. Server-Side Caching:**

* Implement server-side caching mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of stale content being cached.

**9. Monitor and Audit:**

* Regularly monitor and audit caching headers and configurations to ensure they are effectively preventing storable and cacheable content issues.

**10. Patch and Update:**

* Keep the Apache server and its modules up to date with the latest security patches to address any vulnerabilities that may compromise caching security.
