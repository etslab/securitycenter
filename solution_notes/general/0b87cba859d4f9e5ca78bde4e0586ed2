**Solution:**

This issue is caused by using the `ENTRYPOINT` directive in the Dockerfile without specifying a command. As a result, the container will start without executing any command. To fix this issue, specify a valid command using the `ENTRYPOINT` directive. For example:

```
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

Alternatively, you can use the `CMD` directive to execute a command when the container starts. For example:

```
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

The `docker:S7031` rule in SonarQube scans Dockerfiles and ensures that they use either the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` directive to specify a command to execute when the container starts. This rule helps prevent security issues by ensuring that the container will always execute a valid command when it starts.

In this case, the Dockerfile for Apache does not specify a command to execute when the container starts. This could lead to a security issue if the container is started without a valid command. For example, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code on the container.

By specifying a valid command using the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` directive, you can fix this issue and prevent potential security risks.
