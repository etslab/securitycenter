**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Edit the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf):**

    ```
    sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    ```

2. **Locate the following line:**

    ```
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/access_log combined
    ```

3. **Add the following line after the above line:**

    ```
    LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined_authn
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/authn_log combined_authn
    ```

4. **Restart the Apache service:**

    ```
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

**Explanation:**

The above configuration changes will enable logging of authentication-related events, including logon and logoff events, to the `/var/log/httpd/authn_log` file. This will provide a record of user authentication activities for audit purposes.
