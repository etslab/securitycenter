**Severity: High**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category: A1: Injection**

**Reasoning:**

The X-Content-Type-Options header helps protect against MIME sniffing attacks, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable server. By disabling MIME sniffing, the browser is forced to use the content type specified in the HTTP response, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, add the following header to your Apache server configuration:

```apache
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
```

This header will instruct the browser to not perform MIME sniffing and to always use the content type specified in the HTTP response.

**Steps to Implement the Solution:**

1. Open the Apache configuration file (usually located at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`) using a text editor.
2. Add the following line to the configuration file:
```
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
```
3. Save the changes to the configuration file.
4. Restart the Apache server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `nosniff` value prevents the browser from performing MIME sniffing, which is the most secure option.
* You may also use the `deny` value, which instructs the browser to treat all responses as text/plain, but this is less secure than `nosniff`.
