## Severity of the Issue

The severity of the issue "Policy Authentication Policy Change in Registry Policy Change in apache server" can be classified as **medium**. While this issue does not pose an immediate risk to data confidentiality or integrity, it can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if not addressed.

## Solution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Review Apache Configuration:**
   - Check the Apache configuration file `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` or `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
2. **Disable Directory Listing:**
   - By default, Apache may list the contents of directories. To disable this behavior, add the following directive:
   ```
   Options -Indexes
   ```
3. **Restrict Directory Access:**
   - Use the `<Directory>` directive to restrict access to specific directories, such as:
   ```
   <Directory /var/www/html>
     Require all denied
   </Directory>
   ```
4. **Configure Authentication:**
   - Implement authentication using a method appropriate for your environment, such as `.htaccess`, Basic Auth, or LDAP. Ensure that the authentication policy meets your security requirements.
5. **Use SSL/TLS Encryption:**
   - Enable SSL/TLS encryption to protect the transmission of sensitive data. Configure the server with a valid SSL certificate.
6. **Regularly Audit and Update:**
   - Periodically review and update your Apache configuration to identify and mitigate any security vulnerabilities.
