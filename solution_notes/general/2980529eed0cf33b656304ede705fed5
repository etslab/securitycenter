**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

The issue arises when the `admin/index.php` page in bWAPP fails to properly validate the user's session before allowing access to administrative functions. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the session cookie or URL parameters to impersonate an administrator and access sensitive information.

To fix this issue, implement proper session management practices, including:

* **Validate user sessions on every request:** Verify that the user's session is valid and has not been tampered with.
* **Use strong session identifiers:** Generate unique and unpredictable session IDs that are difficult to guess or brute-force.
* **Invalidate sessions on logout or inactivity:** Expire sessions after a period of inactivity or when the user logs out.
* **Consider using CSRF tokens:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent attackers from submitting malicious requests on behalf of legitimate users.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regularly update server software and components to patch any known vulnerabilities.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious requests.
* Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential weaknesses.
