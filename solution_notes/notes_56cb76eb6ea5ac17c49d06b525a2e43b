**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Description:**

After sending a GOAWAY message, Apache servers may continue to handle HTTP requests, potentially allowing attackers to bypass access control checks. This can lead to sensitive data disclosure or unauthorized modifications.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you should update Apache to a version that addresses this vulnerability (2.4.51 or later). Additionally, you can disable the "AllowEncodedSlashes" directive in the Apache configuration to prevent attackers from bypassing access control based on URL encoding.

**Steps to fix the issue:**

1. Update Apache to a version that addresses the vulnerability (2.4.51 or later).
2. Restart Apache.
3. Add the following directive to the Apache configuration:
```
AllowEncodedSlashes Off
```
4. Restart Apache again.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue affects Apache servers that are configured to support HTTP/2.
* Attackers can use this vulnerability to bypass access control checks even if the server has proper authentication mechanisms in place.
* It is important to note that this issue is not specific to Go but rather affects Apache servers in general.
