**Detailed Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) as an administrator.
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PrivateProfile
    ```
3. Locate the DisableNotifications DWORD value.
4. Double-click on the DisableNotifications value and change its value data to 0.
5. Click OK to save the changes.
6. Restart the firewall service by running the following command in a command prompt:
    ```
    net stop firewallapisrv
    net start firewallapisrv
    ```

**Explanation:**

The Policy DisableNotifications value in the registry determines whether to disable notifications from the Windows Firewall. If this value is set to 1, notifications from the firewall will be disabled, which can compromise the security of the server by preventing users from being alerted to potential attacks or unauthorized access. By setting this value to 0, notifications will be enabled, allowing users to be informed about any security threats or breaches.
