**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control (BAC)

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Identify the Policy Filtering Platform (PFP) Packet Drop:**

* Use the command `netsh pfp show state all` to determine if there are any packet drops in the PFP layer.
* Look for any entries indicating "Drop" in the "State" column.

**2. Configure the Registry Access Control List (ACL):**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to the registry key associated with the registry object experiencing the packet drop.
* Right-click on the registry key and select "Permissions".
* Add the "Authenticated Users" group to the list of permissions and grant them "Full Control" permissions.

**3. Modify the PFP ACL:**

* Open the PFP configuration file (pfp.ini) located at `%windir%\system32\drivers\etc\`.
* In the `[acl]` section, add a line that grants access to the registry key. For example:

```
[acl]
; Allow Authenticated Users full control of HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IIS
allow {ADGUID OF AUTHENTICATED USERS} {registry key} all
```

**4. Restart the PFP Service:**

* In an elevated command prompt, run the following command:

```
net stop pfp
net start pfp
```

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to note that modifying the Registry ACL can have security implications. Ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of the security implications before making any changes.
* If the issue persists, check the Windows Event Logs for additional error messages that may provide further insights into the root cause.
