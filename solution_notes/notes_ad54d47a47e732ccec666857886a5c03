**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to configure your Apache server to use a more secure cipher suite. You can do this by editing the `SSLProtocol` and `SSLCipherSuite` directives in the Apache configuration file.

For example, you can add the following lines to your Apache configuration file:

```
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS:!RC4:!3DES:!DES:!CBC:!DH
```

This will configure Apache to use a more secure cipher suite that includes AES-256 with SHA-256.

**Additional Notes:**

* It is important to note that changing the cipher suite may affect the compatibility of your server with older clients.
* You should test your server after making any changes to the cipher suite to ensure that it is still functioning properly.
* You should also monitor your server logs for any errors or warnings related to the cipher suite.
