**Solution:**

To fix this issue, update the `minSdkVersion` in the Android project to 29 or higher, which is the minimum SDK version required to support Android 8.0.

**To update the minSdkVersion:**

1. Open the Android project's `build.gradle` file.
2. Locate the `minSdkVersion` property under the `defaultConfig` block.
3. Change the value to 29 or higher, as shown below:

```
defaultConfig {
    ...
    minSdkVersion 29
}
```

4. Save and build the project.

Once the `minSdkVersion` is updated, the app will no longer be installable on Android versions below 8.0, mitigating the security risk.
