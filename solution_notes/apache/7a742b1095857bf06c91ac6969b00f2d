**Issue:**
Policy 140C in the Windows Registry controls whether the browser can download unsigned ActiveX controls without prompting the user. Leaving this setting to its default value of 3 allows unsigned ActiveX controls to be downloaded and executed without any user interaction, which can lead to malicious code execution.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to set the Policy 140C value to 0. This will prevent the browser from downloading unsigned ActiveX controls without prompting the user.

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3
    ```
3. In the right-hand pane, locate the DWORD value named "140C".
4. Double-click on "140C" and set its value to 0.
5. Click OK to save the changes.
6. Close the Registry Editor.

**Note:** This solution applies to Internet Explorer and other browsers that use the same registry settings.
