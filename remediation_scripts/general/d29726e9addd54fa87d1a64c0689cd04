####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 HSTS, not offered in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 HSTS, not offered in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed. Please install it before applying this patch."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the HSTS module is enabled
if ! grep -q "LoadModule hsts_module" /etc/apache2/mods-available/hsts.load; then
  echo "The HSTS module is not enabled. Please enable it before applying this patch."
  exit 1
fi

# Create a backup of the HSTS configuration file
cp /etc/apache2/mods-available/hsts.conf /etc/apache2/mods-available/hsts.conf.bak

# Edit the HSTS configuration file
sed -i -e "s/secure;/secure; includeSubDomains; preload;/" /etc/apache2/mods-available/hsts.conf

# Enable the HSTS module
a2enmod hsts

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart

# Check if the HSTS configuration is correct
apache2ctl -t | grep "hsts"

# If the HSTS configuration is correct, exit with success
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "HSTS configuration is correct."
  exit 0
else
  echo "HSTS configuration is incorrect. Please check the HSTS configuration file."
  exit 1
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is installed and the HSTS module is enabled. If either of these conditions are not met, the script will exit with an error message. If both conditions are met, the script will create a backup of the HSTS configuration file, edit the file to include the `includeSubDomains` and `preload` directives, enable the HSTS module, and restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the HSTS configuration is correct. If it is, the script will exit with success. Otherwise, the script will exit with an error message.
