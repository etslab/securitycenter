**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Issue Description:**

The Policy File System (PFS) in Registry Object Access (ROA) is vulnerable to injection attacks. PFS allows a user to create files with system-wide permissions by writing to specific registry keys. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the registry and modify system settings.

**Solution:**

1. **Restrict Registry Access:** Limit the permissions for accessing the ROA registry keys to only authorized users or processes.

2. **Implement Input Validation:** Validate all user-provided input before it is written to the registry. Sanitize and encode input strings to prevent the injection of malicious characters.

3. **Disable Inheritance:** Prevent child objects from inheriting permissions from parent objects. This ensures that any modifications to permissions only affect the specific object being modified.

4. **Implement a File Integrity Monitor (FIM):** Monitor the PFS for unauthorized modifications and alert administrators of any suspicious activity.

5. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Configure a WAF to block requests that contain malicious payloads or patterns associated with injection attacks.

**Additional Tips:**

* Keep the server and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly review registry permissions and make any necessary adjustments.
* Educate users about the risks of injection attacks and train them to avoid suspicious links or attachments.
