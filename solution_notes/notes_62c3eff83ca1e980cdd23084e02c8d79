**Severity of the Issue:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Root Cause:**
   - Check if the "LogonLogoff" value in the registry under `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` is set to 0.

2. **Configure the Registry:**
   - Set the "LogonLogoff" value to 1 using the following command:
   ```
   reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v LogonLogoff /t REG_DWORD /d 1
   ```

3. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart the Apache server for the changes to take effect.

4. **Verify the Change:**
   - Run a registry query to confirm that the "LogonLogoff" value is set to 1:
   ```
   reg query "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" /v LogonLogoff
   ```

**Additional Information:**

* The "LogonLogoff" value controls whether the Windows Event Log is written when a user logs on or off.
* By default, this value is set to 0, which means that no logging occurs.
* Setting the value to 1 enables logging for both logon and logoff events.
* This is a critical security measure because it allows administrators to track user activity and detect any suspicious or unauthorized access.
