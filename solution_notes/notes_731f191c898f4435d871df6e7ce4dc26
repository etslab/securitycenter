**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A6: Security Misconfiguration

**Impact:**
DisableIPSourceRouting is a security setting that prevents the system from forwarding IP packets with a source IP address that is different from the interface to which the packet was received. This setting helps prevent spoofing attacks, where an attacker sends packets with a fake source IP address to impersonate another system or gain unauthorized access.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, set the DisableIPSourceRouting parameter to 1 in the registry. The steps to do this are:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip6\Parameters
```
3. In the right pane, double-click the DisableIPSourceRouting value.
4. Enter 1 in the Value data field.
5. Click OK.

**Additional Information:**
The DisableIPSourceRouting setting is part of a group of settings that control IP spoofing protection. These settings are important for protecting systems from spoofing attacks, which can be used to gain unauthorized access or launch other attacks.

It is recommended that all systems have DisableIPSourceRouting set to 1 to prevent spoofing attacks.
