####patch script to remediate  CVE-2019-6110 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2019-6110 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the vulnerable version of Apache is installed
VERSION=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')
if [[ "$VERSION" == "2.4.25" ]]; then
  echo "Apache 2.4.25 is vulnerable to CVE-2019-6110."
  echo "Patching..."

  # Download the patch
  wget https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/2.4/apply_2.4.25.patch

  # Apply the patch
  patch -p1 < apply_2.4.25.patch

  # Restart Apache
  service apache2 restart

  echo "Patch applied successfully."
else
  echo "Apache 2.4.25 is not installed."
fi
```

This patch will fix the vulnerability in Apache 2.4.25. It is important to note that this patch is only for Apache 2.4.25. If you are running a different version of Apache, you will need to find a patch for that specific version.

Once you have applied the patch, you should restart Apache. This will ensure that the patch is applied and that Apache is running securely.
