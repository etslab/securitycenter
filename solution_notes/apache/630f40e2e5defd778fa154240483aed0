**Solution:**

1. **Enable the Policy:** Navigate to "Registry Editor" (regedit.exe) and locate the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\LAPS
```

2. **Create the ADBackupDSRMPassword Value:** If the "ADBackupDSRMPassword" value does not exist, right-click the "LAPS" key and select "New" > "String Value." Name the new value "ADBackupDSRMPassword."

3. **Set the Value:** Double-click the "ADBackupDSRMPassword" value and set its data to the following (without quotes):

```
"password"
```

4. **Replace "password" with a Strong Password:** The actual password should be a strong, unique, and complex password.

5. **Confirm the Value:** Click "OK" to save the password.

**Additional Notes:**

* The ADBackupDSRMPassword registry value stores the password used for backing up the Active Directory Replication Services Database (DSRM).
* This password should be strong and secure to prevent unauthorized access to the DSRM data.
* Leaving this password blank or insecure can compromise the security of the server.
