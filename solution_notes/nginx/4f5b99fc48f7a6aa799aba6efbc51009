###How to fix the Certificates issue of LUCKY13, potentially vulnerable uses TLS CBC ciphers in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the LUCKY13 certificates issue in nginx, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the nginx configuration file.
2. Locate the section that defines the ciphers that are used for TLS connections.
3. Remove any ciphers that use CBC mode.
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Restart nginx.

The LUCKY13 attack is a side-channel attack that can be used to recover plaintext data from encrypted communications. The attack works by exploiting the timing differences between different encryption and decryption operations. CBC mode is a block cipher mode that is vulnerable to the LUCKY13 attack.

The LUCKY13 issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of Insufficient Transport Layer Security (TLS). This category includes risks that arise from the use of weak or insecure TLS ciphers.

Here are some additional tips for securing your nginx web server:

* Use a strong password for the nginx user account.
* Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
* Enable Server Name Indication (SNI).
* Use a modern TLS version, such as TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3.
* Disable support for old TLS versions, such as TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.
* Disable support for weak ciphers.
* Use a certificate that is issued by a trusted certificate authority.
* Keep your nginx software up to date.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your nginx web server from attack.
