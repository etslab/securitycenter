**Solution:**

The Policy MaxTicketExpiryUnits registry key determines the maximum lifetime of session tickets issued by the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server. A low value for this key can reduce the risk of attackers exploiting the "ticket relay" vulnerability.

**Steps to Fix:**

1. On the RDP server, open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services
   ```
3. Create or modify the MaxTicketExpiryUnits DWORD value:
   - Data type: REG_DWORD
   - Value: 3600000 (1 hour, default)
4. Restart the RDP service or reboot the server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The optimal value for MaxTicketExpiryUnits depends on the security requirements of the organization. A lower value increases security but may impact user experience.
* Disabling RDP completely is the most secure option, but it may not be practical in all cases.
* Use additional security measures, such as strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and network monitoring, to mitigate the risk of successful RDP attacks.
