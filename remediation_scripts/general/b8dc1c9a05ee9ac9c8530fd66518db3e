####patch script to remediate  Unexpected Content-Type was returned in Apache HTTP Server
Here is a patch script that can be used to remediate the Unexpected Content-Type was returned error in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then

  # Get the current Apache configuration
  apache_config=$(cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf)

  # Find the line that defines the Content-Type for the affected file
  content_type_line=$(echo "$apache_config" | grep -i "content-type")

  # If the Content-Type is not correct, update it
  if [ -n "$content_type_line" ]; then

    # Get the correct Content-Type for the file
    correct_content_type=$(file -b --mime-type "$file")

    # Update the Content-Type line
    sed -i "s/$content_type_line/$correct_content_type/" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

  fi

  # Restart Apache
  service apache2 restart

fi
```

This script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then get the current Apache configuration. The script will then find the line in the configuration that defines the Content-Type for the affected file. If the Content-Type is not correct, the script will update it. Finally, the script will restart Apache.

This script should be used with caution. If you are not familiar with Apache configuration, you should consult with a system administrator before running this script.
