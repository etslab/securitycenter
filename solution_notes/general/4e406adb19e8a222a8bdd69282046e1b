**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. **Disable Registry LogonLogoff Policy:**

   - Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.
   - Set the following registry values to `0`:
     - `RegistryLogonLogoffPolicy`
     - `RegistryLogonLogoffPolicyAltSecId`

2. **Use a More Secure Method for Logging On:**

   - Use smart cards or biometrics for authentication instead of passwords.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3. **Implement Password Policies:**

   - Enforce strong password policies, including minimum length, complexity, and expiration.
   - Lock out accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

4. **Monitor Access Logs:**

   - Regularly monitor security logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts.

5. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**

   - Implement a WAF to block unauthorized access attempts and mitigate vulnerabilities like Broken Access Control.

**Additional Information:**

The Registry LogonLogoff Policy can grant users with local administrator privileges access to the registry even if they do not have explicit permissions. By disabling this policy, you restrict access to the registry and prevent attackers from gaining unauthorized access to sensitive system settings.
