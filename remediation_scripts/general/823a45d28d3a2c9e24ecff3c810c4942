####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie No HttpOnly Flag in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie No HttpOnly Flag in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Get the current version of Apache
current_version=$(apache2 -v | awk '{print $2}')

# Check if the current version is vulnerable
if [[ $current_version < 2.4.6 ]]; then
  echo "Apache $current_version is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169."

  # Create a backup of the httpd.conf file
  cp /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.bak

  # Open the httpd.conf file for editing
  vi /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

  # Find the line that starts with "Cookie"
  line=$(grep -n "Cookie" /etc/apache2/httpd.conf | awk '{print $1}')

  # Add the "HttpOnly" flag to the line
  sed -i "$line i HttpOnly" /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

  # Save and close the file
  :wq

  # Restart Apache
  service apache2 restart

  echo "Apache has been patched."
else
  echo "Apache $current_version is not vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169."
fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is installed. If it is, the script will get the current version of Apache. If the current version is vulnerable to CVE-2013-0169, the script will create a backup of the httpd.conf file, open the file for editing, find the line that starts with "Cookie", and add the "HttpOnly" flag to the line. The script will then save and close the file, restart Apache, and notify the user that Apache has been patched. If the current version of Apache is not vulnerable, the script will notify the user that Apache is not vulnerable.
