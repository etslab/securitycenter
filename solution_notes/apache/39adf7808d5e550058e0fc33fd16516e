###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2021-34798
CVE-2021-34798 is a vulnerability in the Apache HTTP Server that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack. The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference in the mod_proxy_balancer module.

To fix this vulnerability, you should upgrade your Apache HTTP Server to a version that is not affected by the vulnerability. You can find the latest version of Apache HTTP Server at the Apache Software Foundation website.

The CVE-2021-34798 vulnerability belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of "Injection." Injection vulnerabilities occur when unvalidated data is inserted into an application in a way that can alter the application's behavior. This can lead to a variety of security problems, including DoS attacks, data modification, and privilege escalation.

To prevent injection vulnerabilities, you should always validate all input data before using it in your application. You should also use a web application firewall (WAF) to help protect your application from common injection attacks.

Here are some additional steps you can take to protect your Apache HTTP Server from security vulnerabilities:

* Keep your Apache HTTP Server software up to date.
* Use a strong password for your Apache HTTP Server account.
* Enable the mod_security module.
* Use a WAF.
* Monitor your Apache HTTP Server for signs of attack.
