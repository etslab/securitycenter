**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Injection

**Description:**

The reported issue in `dvwaPage.inc.php` is related to insufficient input validation and can lead to information disclosure or code execution attacks if exploited. Specifically, the issue is caused by the use of unsafe functions like `mysql_query()` and `mysqli_query()` without proper input validation and sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue and improve the security of your application, follow these steps:

1. Update the vulnerable code in `dvwaPage.inc.php` to use prepared statements with parameterized queries.
2. Use a database abstraction layer (e.g., PDO) for database interaction to simplify and enhance the security of your database operations.
3. Implement proper input validation and sanitization to filter out malicious characters and prevent SQL injection attacks.
4. Use secure coding practices, such as input validation and output escaping, to prevent malicious payloads from being executed.
5. Regularly update your software and dependencies to patch any known vulnerabilities.

**Example Code (PDO):**

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```
