**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1: Injection

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Vulnerable Files:**
   - Use server logs or tools like Nikto to identify files with redirects using HTTP headers like "Location" or "Refresh."
   - Check for files that are accessible without authentication or authorization.

2. **Disable Extraneous Redirects:**
   - Remove or disable unnecessary redirects from the identified files.
   - Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block suspicious incoming requests that attempt to trigger redirects.

3. **Encode User Input:**
   - Ensure that user input is properly encoded before processing it in the application.
   - Use HTML character entities or functions like `htmlspecialchars()` to encode special characters and prevent attackers from injecting malicious code.

4. **Enable Input Validation and Filtering:**
   - Implement input validation to check for expected values and reject any malicious or unexpected inputs.
   - Use regular expressions or input filters to restrict the type and format of user input.

5. **Secure Cookie Management:**
   - Ensure that cookies are securely configured and prevent session hijacking.
   - Set appropriate cookie attributes such as `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` to restrict unauthorized access.

6. **Use SSL/TLS Encryption:**
   - Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all sensitive pages and forms to protect data from eavesdropping.
   - Use a strong cipher suite and ensure that certificates are valid and trusted.

7. **Update and Patch Software:**
   - Keep the Apache server and all software up to date with the latest security patches.
   - Apply security patches promptly to fix known vulnerabilities that could lead to redirects.
