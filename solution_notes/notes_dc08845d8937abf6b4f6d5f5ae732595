**Severity: High**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category: Broken Access Control**

**Solution:**

1. **Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**: ASLR randomizes the memory addresses of sensitive data structures, making it harder for attackers to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
2. **Disable Kernel Debugging:** Kernel debugging exposes the kernel to attackers, allowing them to gain root privileges.
3. **Implement Proper Input Validation:** Sanitize user input to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code or commands.
4. **Use a Secure Coding Framework:** Adopt a coding framework such as OWASP ESAPI or Google's Guice that provides built-in security protections.
5. **Consider Using Android Root Detection Libraries:** Utilize third-party libraries specifically designed for Android root detection, such as SafetyNet.
6. **Monitor for Root Access Attempts:** Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to suspicious activities indicating root access.
7. **Enforce Device Integrity:** Verify that the device is not rooted or tampered with before granting access to sensitive data or functionality.
8. **Update Android OS Regularly:** Keep the Android OS and all installed apps up to date to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain root access.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Use a trusted certificate authority for SSL/TLS encryption.
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
* Restrict file and directory permissions to minimize the impact of successful attacks.
* Regularly review and update security configurations.
