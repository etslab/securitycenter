**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Update Apache:**

* Upgrade to Apache Http Server versions 2.4.56, 2.5.48, or later. These versions contain patches for the vulnerability.

**2. Configure limits (optional):**

* Add the following lines to your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf):

```
RequestHeaderLimit 30000
LimitXMLRequestBody 32000000
```

* These directives limit the size of headers and XML request bodies, respectively.

**3. Implement rate limiting (optional):**

* Consider implementing rate limiting mechanisms to prevent excessive traffic and potential attacks.

**4. Restrict access to Trac:**

* If you don't use Trac, disable it or restrict access to it by adding the following lines to your configuration file:

```
<Location /trac/>
  Require all denied
</Location>
```

**5. Patch Trac (for Trac users):**

* If you use Trac, apply the patch provided by the Trac team: https://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/ExpatVulnerability

**6. Disable or remove Trac (for Trac users):**

* If you no longer need Trac, disable or remove it from your Apache configuration.
