###How to fix the App Dependencies issue of hosted-git-info:2.8.8 of pkg:npm/hosted-git-info@2.8.8 in apache web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
The App Dependencies issue of hosted-git-info:2.8.8 of pkg:npm/hosted-git-info@2.8.8 in Apache web server can be fixed by upgrading the hosted-git-info dependency to a newer version. The vulnerability that this issue is related to is CVE-2021-23362, which is a remote code execution vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by exploiting a flaw in the hosted-git-info module.

To fix this issue, you can use the following steps:

1. Use the `npm ls` command to list all of the dependencies for your project.
2. Look for the `hosted-git-info` dependency.
3. If the version of the dependency is 2.8.8 or lower, upgrade it to a newer version.
4. Once you have upgraded the dependency, restart your Apache web server.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category that this issue belongs to is Injection. Injection vulnerabilities occur when untrusted data is inserted into code or data structures in a way that can cause unintended consequences. In this case, the untrusted data is the attacker's code, which is injected into the hosted-git-info module. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Here are some additional tips for preventing injection vulnerabilities:

* Use input validation to ensure that all user input is properly sanitized before it is used in code or data structures.
* Use prepared statements instead of dynamic SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* Use object-oriented programming techniques to encapsulate data and code, which can help to prevent code injection attacks.
* Use secure coding practices to help prevent injection vulnerabilities.

By following these tips, you can help to protect your web applications from injection vulnerabilities.
