**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Denial of Service (DoS)

**Issue Description:**

The issue arises from the improper handling of HTTP requests by the net/http package in Go. Attackers can craft malicious requests with excessive body content or headers, causing the Apache server to consume excessive resources and potentially lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.

**Solution:**

To mitigate this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Use a Content-Length Header:** Determine the expected content length of requests and configure Apache to enforce these limits.
```apache
<LimitRequestBody>
MaxRequestSize 1048576
</LimitRequestBody>
```

2. **Limit the Size of Header Fields:** Set a limit on the maximum size of header fields to prevent attackers from sending excessively long headers.
```go
r.Header.Set("Max-Header-Size", "512")
```

3. **Use a Body Read Size Limit:** Set a limit on the maximum size of the request body to prevent excessive resource consumption.
```go
r.Body = http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, 1048576)
```

4. **Use a Timeout:** Configure a timeout for HTTP requests to prevent attackers from keeping connections open indefinitely.
```go
client := &http.Client{
  Timeout: 10 * time.Second,
}
```

5. **Enable Compression:** Enable compression to reduce the size of HTTP requests and responses.
```apache
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
</IfModule>
```

6. **Avoid Parsing Large XML or JSON Requests:** If an application requires handling large XML or JSON requests, consider using specialized parsing libraries that can handle large files efficiently.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending excessive requests.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.
* Monitor server resources, such as CPU and memory, and respond promptly to spikes in usage.
