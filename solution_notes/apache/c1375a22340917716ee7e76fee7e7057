**Problem:**

When an application binary has rpath set in an Apache server, it means that the binary can search for libraries in non-standard locations. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as library hijacking, where an attacker can replace the legitimate library with a malicious one.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, remove the rpath setting from the application binary. This can be done by rebuilding the binary with the `-Wl,-rpath-link=none` flag.

Alternatively, you can set the ld.so.conf file to only include trusted library paths. This can be done by adding the following line to the /etc/ld.so.conf file:

```
include /path/to/trusted/library/path
```

**Impact:**

This issue can lead to the following impacts:

* **Library hijacking:** An attacker can replace a legitimate library with a malicious one, which can then be used to compromise the application.
* **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can use a malicious library to gain elevated privileges on the server.
* **Data leakage:** An attacker can use a malicious library to steal sensitive data from the application.

**Recommendations:**

* Remove the rpath setting from all application binaries.
* Set the ld.so.conf file to only include trusted library paths.
* Regularly audit your server for any unauthorized changes to the ld.so.conf file.
