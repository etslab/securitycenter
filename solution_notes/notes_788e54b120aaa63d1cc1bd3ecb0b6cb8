**Severity: Critical**

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A1 - Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

**1. Disable Policy Security System Extension:**

* Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters\`
* Locate the value named `PolicySecuritySystemExtension` and double-click it.
* Change the Value data to `0` and click OK.

**2. Restart Apache Server:**

* Open a command prompt as an administrator.
* Run the following command:

```
net stop apache2 && net start apache2
```

**3. Verify:**

* Navigate to the Registry Editor again and check if the `PolicySecuritySystemExtension` value is now set to `0`.
* Restart Apache Server.

**Additional Information:**

The Policy Security System Extension allows users to define their own access control policies, which can bypass default Apache security mechanisms. This makes it possible for attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or execute malicious code.

Disabling the Policy Security System Extension removes this vulnerability and restores the default security settings of Apache. It is recommended to keep this extension disabled unless there is a specific need for it.
