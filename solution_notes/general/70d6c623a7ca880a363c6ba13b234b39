**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A07: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Issue Description:**

HTML comments are not properly escaped when they appear within script contexts (e.g., `<script>`, `<template>`). This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the page, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.

**Solution:**

The code should properly escape HTML comments within script contexts using appropriate mechanisms, such as the `html/template.HTML` type. An example of a fixed code is provided below:

```go
t, err := template.New("example").Parse(`<script>{{.Comment}}</script>`)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

err = t.Execute(w, struct{ Comment string }{Comment: template.HTML("<p>Hello, world!</p>")})
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

In this example, the HTML comment is escaped using the `template.HTML` type. This ensures that the comment is treated as text by the browser, preventing any unintended execution.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue should be fixed as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.
* It is also recommended to review the entire codebase for similar vulnerabilities and implement appropriate remediation measures.
* Consider using a web application security testing tool to identify and fix any remaining vulnerabilities.
