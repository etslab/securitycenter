**Severity Level:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control (A01)

**Detailed Solution:**

**1. Determine the Scope of the Issue:**
* Identify the specific policy change that is causing the authentication issue.
* Find out which resources or applications are affected by the change.

**2. Review the Original Policy:**
* Examine the original policy configuration and compare it to the new one.
* Look for any changes that may have weakened the authentication mechanism.

**3. Restore the Original Policy:**
* If possible, revert the changes back to the original policy configuration.
* This should immediately resolve the authentication issue.

**4. Implement Stronger Authentication:**
* If reverting to the original policy is not an option, consider implementing stronger authentication measures.
* Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) or use a more robust authentication mechanism.

**5. Update Security Software:**
* Ensure that all security software, such as antivirus and firewall, is up to date.
* Install any necessary security patches or updates.

**6. Monitor and Audit Access:**
* Regularly monitor system logs to detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
* Implement an auditing system to track changes to security policies and configurations.

**7. Train Employees on Security:**
* Educate employees on the importance of secure authentication practices.
* Train them to report any suspicious activities or compromised credentials.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use strong passwords and change them regularly.
* Implement role-based access control to limit access to resources based on user privileges.
* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic.
