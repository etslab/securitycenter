###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens
The absence of anti-CSRF tokens in an Apache web server can be fixed by adding a CSRF token to each form that performs a sensitive action. A CSRF token is a unique, secret value that is generated by the server and sent to the client in the form of a hidden input field. When the user submits the form, the server validates the token to ensure that it was not tampered with. If the token is invalid, the request is rejected.

To add a CSRF token to a form in Apache, you can use the following code:

```
<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<%= csrf_token %>">
```

where `csrf_token` is a unique value generated by the server.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category for this issue is A3: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). CSRF attacks allow an attacker to trick a user into performing an action on a website that they did not intend to do. This can be used to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, or to perform unauthorized actions, such as making a purchase.

Here are some additional tips for preventing CSRF attacks:

* Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
* Be careful about what links you click on, especially in emails and social media messages.
* Install a security plugin for your browser, such as uBlock Origin or NoScript.
* Keep your software up to date.

By following these tips, you can help to protect yourself from CSRF attacks.
