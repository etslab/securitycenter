To fix the App Dependencies issue of zip_cp437_header.zip in the Nginx web server, you can:

1. **Update the Nginx package.** The zip_cp437_header.zip dependency was removed from Nginx in version 1.18.0, so updating to a newer version of Nginx should resolve the issue.

2. **Manually install the zip_cp437_header dependency.** If you are unable to update the Nginx package, you can manually install the zip_cp437_header dependency. To do this, download the zip_cp437_header.zip file from the Nginx website and extract it to the Nginx modules directory. Then, add the following line to the Nginx configuration file:

```
