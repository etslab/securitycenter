**Solution:**

1. Update to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.57 or later.

4. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests.

**Assessment:**

CVE-2023-42116 is a vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server that allows an attacker to access restricted files. This is a high-severity issue because it could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information, such as website source code or user data.

The vulnerability is caused by an insecure default configuration in Apache HTTP Server. By default, the DefaultType directive is set to "text/plain", which allows attackers to access files with arbitrary extensions by simply adding a ".txt" extension to the filename.

To fix this issue, it is recommended to update to Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.57 or later, which includes a fix for this vulnerability. Additionally, you can disable the DefaultType directive by setting it to "none" or implement a WAF to block malicious requests.
