**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Policy AddPrinterDrivers registry key in the Print Services section controls the ability of users to install printer drivers. By default, this key is set to 0, which allows any user to install printer drivers. However, if this key is set to something other than 0, only users with the appropriate permissions can install printer drivers.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should set the Policy AddPrinterDrivers registry key to 0. This will allow any user to install printer drivers.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Open the Registry Editor by pressing Windows Key + R and typing "regedit".
2. Navigate to the following key:
    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanMan Print Services\Servers
    ```
3. Right-click on the Servers key and select "New" -> "DWORD (32-bit) Value".
4. Name the new value "Policy AddPrinterDrivers".
5. Double-click on the new value and set the value data to 0.
6. Click "OK" to save your changes.

**Additional Information:**

This issue is considered a medium risk because it could allow unauthorized users to install malicious printer drivers on the server. This could give attackers the ability to take control of the server or steal sensitive information.
