* **Description:** Broken access control is the most commonly seen web application security vulnerability. It allows attackers to access unauthorized data, execute unauthorized actions, or perform other actions that they should not be able to do.
* **Impact:** Broken access control can have a significant impact on an organization, including:
    * Data breaches
    * Financial losses
    * Reputational damage
* **Recommendations:** To mitigate the risk of broken access control, organizations should implement the following security controls:
    * Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user access to data and functionality
    * Implement input validation to prevent attackers from injecting malicious code into web applications
    * Use secure coding practices to develop web applications that are resistant to attack

I hope this helps!
