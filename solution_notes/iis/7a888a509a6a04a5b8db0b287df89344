**Solution:**

1. **Disable Server Signature in IIS:**
   - Open IIS Manager.
   - Select the website or server for which you want to disable server signature.
   - Double-click on "HTTP Response Headers".
   - Clear the "Values" field for the "Server" header.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

2. **Configure HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Enable HSTS in your web server configuration.
   - Set the header value to "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload".
   - This will force browsers to use only HTTPS connections and prevent accidental exposure of the server version.

3. **Consider Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
   - A WAF can filter out requests based on specific criteria, including server version leaks.
   - Configure the WAF to block requests that contain harmful patterns, such as specific server version strings.

4. **Update and Patch Server Software Regularly:**
   - Keep your server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Install any updates that address vulnerabilities related to server version leakage.

5. **Use a Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Implement a CSP in your web application.
   - Include a directive that prevents the application from leaking server information, such as:
   ```
   default-src 'self';
   script-src 'self';
   object-src 'none';
   report-uri /csp-report-endpoint
   ```
