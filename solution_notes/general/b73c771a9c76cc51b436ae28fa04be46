CVE-2021-26691 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of "Injection." Injection flaws occur when unvalidated or malicious data is inserted into an application. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including data modification, privilege escalation, and denial-of-service.

To prevent injection attacks, it is important to validate all input data before it is used by an application. This can be done by using a variety of techniques, such as input validation libraries, regular expressions, and white lists.

In addition to input validation, it is also important to implement other security controls, such as:

* Strong passwords and authentication
* File permissions
* Data encryption
* Web application firewalls

By implementing these security controls, you can help to protect your web applications from injection attacks and other security threats.
