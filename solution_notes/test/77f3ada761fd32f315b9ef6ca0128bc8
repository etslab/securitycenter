**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A4: Broken Authentication

**Solution:**

**1. Use Group Policy Editor:**

* Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
* Navigate to `Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options`.
* Locate the policy "`Network security: LAN Manager authentication level`" and double-click it.
* Select "Send NTLMv2 response only" and click OK.

**2. Use Registry Editor:**

* Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
* Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print`.
* Create or modify the DWORD value `RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled` and set its value to 0.

**Verification:**

* Open a command prompt as administrator.
* Run the command: `gpresult /h gpresult.html` to view the applied GPO settings.
* Check that the `RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled` policy is set to 0 in the registry.

**Additional Notes:**

* This setting only affects the print spooler service.
* By default, the value is 1 (Allow NTLM authentication without privacy), which allows for potential downgrade attacks.
* Setting the value to 0 ensures that the print spooler only accepts NTLMv2 authentication, which provides better protection against eavesdropping.
