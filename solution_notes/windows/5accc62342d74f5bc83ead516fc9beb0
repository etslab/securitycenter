**Severity:** Medium

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to configure the `Policy DefaultOutboundAction` registry key to specify the default action for outbound traffic not explicitly allowed by firewall rules. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to the following key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile
   ```
3. Right-click on the "PublicProfile" key and select "New" > "DWORD (32-bit) Value".
4. Name the new value "Policy DefaultOutboundAction".
5. Double-click on the "Policy DefaultOutboundAction" value and set its value data to one of the following:
   - 0: Block
   - 1: Allow
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

**Note:** The default value for `Policy DefaultOutboundAction` is 0 (Block). By setting it to 1, you are allowing outbound traffic that is not explicitly allowed by firewall rules. This can increase the risk of unauthorized data exfiltration or other security incidents.

It is generally recommended to keep `Policy DefaultOutboundAction` set to 0 (Block) and only allow outbound traffic that is necessary for the proper functioning of your system and applications.
