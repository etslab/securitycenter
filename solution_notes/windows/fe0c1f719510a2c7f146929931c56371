**Solution:**

1. **Navigate to Registry:** Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and navigate to the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
```

2. **Enable Strong Key:** Locate the DWORD value named "RequireStrongKey" and double-click on it. Set the Value data to 1 and click OK.

3. **Restart Netlogon:** Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the following command to restart the Netlogon service:

```
net stop netlogon && net start netlogon
```

**Additional Considerations:**

* Ensure that all Domain Controllers in the domain have the RequireStrongKey registry setting enabled.
* If the RequireStrongKey setting is not enabled, the Netlogon service will use weak key encryption for authentication, which can compromise the security of the domain.
* This setting is critical for securing the communication between Domain Controllers and member computers.

**Verification:**

* Check the RequireStrongKey registry value to ensure it is set to 1.
* Use a network sniffer to analyze Netlogon traffic and verify that strong encryption is being used.
