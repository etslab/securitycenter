**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue Description:**

Device Guard's ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch policy in the Windows Registry controls whether only signed and trusted code can run on the system. If this policy is not configured correctly, unsigned or malicious code could be executed, potentially compromising the system.

**Solution:**

1. Navigate to the following registry key:
   ```
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceGuard
   ```

2. Create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch`.

3. Set the value of this DWORD to `1`.

4. Restart the server.

This will enable the ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch policy and enforce that only signed and trusted code can run on the system.

**Additional Information:**

The ConfigureSystemGuardLaunch policy is an important security measure that helps protect against the execution of unauthorized code on the system. By setting this policy to `1`, you can reduce the risk of malware or other malicious software infecting the server and compromising its data or functionality.
