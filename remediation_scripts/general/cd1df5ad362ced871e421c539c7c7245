####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Content Security Policy (CSP) header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Content Security Policy (CSP) header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is installed
if ! [ -x /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then
  echo "Apache is not installed."
  exit 1
fi

# Check if the CSP header is already enabled
if grep -q "Content-Security-Policy" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "The CSP header is already enabled."
  exit 0
fi

# Add the CSP header to Apache's configuration file
echo "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
service apache2 restart

# Check if the CSP header is now enabled
if grep -q "Content-Security-Policy" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "The CSP header has been successfully enabled."
else
  echo "The CSP header could not be enabled."
  exit 1
fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is installed and if the CSP header is already enabled. If the CSP header is not enabled, the script will add it to Apache's configuration file and restart Apache. Finally, the script will check if the CSP header is now enabled.

Please note that this is just a sample patch script and may need to be modified to fit your specific environment.
