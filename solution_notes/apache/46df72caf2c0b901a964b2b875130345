This issue belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of **Cryptographic Failures**. Cryptographic failures can occur when a web application does not use strong cryptography or when it uses cryptography incorrectly. This can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities, including data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.

Here are some additional tips for securing your Apache web server:

* Keep your Apache software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your web server from known vulnerabilities.
* Use a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN can help to protect your web server from DDoS attacks by distributing your website's content across multiple servers.

By following these tips, you can help to secure your Apache web server and protect your website from a variety of security threats.
