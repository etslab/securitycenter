###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Re-examine Cache-control Directives
The Web Threats issue of Re-examine Cache-control Directives in apache web server can be fixed by configuring the Cache-Control header to prevent caching of sensitive information. This can be done by adding the following directives to the Apache configuration file:

```
Header set Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
Header set Pragma "no-cache"
