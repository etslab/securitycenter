**Solution:**

1. **Edit the Registry:**
   - Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile`.

2. **Create or Modify DefaultInboundAction Key:**
   - If the `DefaultInboundAction` key exists, modify its value to `1`.
   - If the key does not exist, create a new DWORD (32-bit) value named `DefaultInboundAction` and set its value to `1`.

3. **Restart the Windows Firewall Service:**
   - In the Services console (services.msc), stop and then start the "Windows Firewall" service.

4. **Verify the Policy:**
   - Run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt:

   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="Default Inbound Rule" profile="Public"
   ```

   - Verify that the "Action" field shows "Allow".

**Explanation:**

The Policy DefaultInboundAction registry value controls the default action for inbound network traffic on the public network profile. By default, this action is set to "Block". Setting it to "1" (Allow) allows all inbound traffic by default.

A misconfigured DefaultInboundAction value can lead to unrestricted access to the apache server from the public internet, exposing it to potential attacks such as remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
