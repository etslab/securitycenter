**Severity:** Critical

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A01: Broken Access Control

**Details:**

The php:S6600 SonarQube rule detects that the `dvwaPage.inc.php` file in the DVWA web application doesn't properly restrict access to sensitive functions. This can allow unauthenticated users to access privileged functionality, such as adding new users or viewing sensitive data.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you should implement proper access control measures to restrict access to sensitive functions based on the user's role or authorization level. This can be done through the following steps:

1. Add a condition to the beginning of the functions that checks the user's authorization level.
2. If the user is not authorized, redirect them to a login page or display an error message.

For example, the following code can be added to the beginning of the `add_user()` function:

```php
if (!current_user_can('add_users')) {
  wp_redirect(wp_login_url());
  exit;
}
```

This code checks if the current user has the `add_users` capability. If the user does not have this capability, they will be redirected to the login page.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Review all other code in your web application to identify and fix any similar issues.
* Implement a comprehensive security testing program to identify and mitigate any other vulnerabilities.
* Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.
