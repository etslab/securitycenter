**Severity:** Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A5:2021 - Security Misconfiguration

**Issue Description:**

The `android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_TOPICS` permission allows an app to interact with ad services topics. Without proper validation, it can lead to an attacker exploiting this permission and accessing sensitive ad-related information or performing unauthorized actions.

**Solution:**

1. **Review and remove unnecessary permissions:** Ensure that the app only requests the necessary permissions. In this case, if ad services are not required, consider removing the `android.permission.ACCESS_ADSERVICES_TOPICS` permission from the manifest file.
2. **Validate input:** Implement input validation to ensure that only authorized users can access ad services topics.
3. **Limit access:** Use access control mechanisms to limit who has access to ad services topics. This can involve using role-based access control (RBAC) or other methods.
4. **Monitor and log activity:** Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track access to ad services topics and detect any suspicious activity.
5. **Update the Apache configuration:** Ensure that the Apache server is configured to deny access to any files or directories containing sensitive ad-related information.

**Additional Notes:**

* This issue can be mitigated by implementing a combination of the solutions mentioned above.
* It is recommended to use a security scanner or testing tool to identify and fix any potential misconfigurations related to permissions.
