The Content Security Policy (CSP) header is a security feature that helps to protect websites from a variety of attacks. CSP works by restricting the types of resources that can be loaded on a website. This can help to prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and code injection.

The OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category for this issue is A1: Injection. Injection flaws, such as XSS, allow attackers to inject malicious code into a website.
