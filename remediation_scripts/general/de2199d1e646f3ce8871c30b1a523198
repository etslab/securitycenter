####patch script to remediate  CVE-2018-15919 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2018-15919 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ -f /usr/sbin/apache2 ]; then

  # Check if the Apache version is vulnerable
  if [[ $(apache2 -V | awk '{print $2}') -lt 2.4.38 ]]; then

    # Download the latest Apache security patch
    wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/latest/httpd-2.4.38.tar.gz

    # Extract the Apache security patch
    tar -xzf httpd-2.4.38.tar.gz

    # Replace the existing Apache binaries with the patched binaries
    cp httpd-2.4.38/bin/* /usr/sbin/

    # Restart Apache
    systemctl restart apache2

  fi

fi
```

This patch script will check if Apache is running and if the Apache version is vulnerable to CVE-2018-15919. If Apache is vulnerable, the patch script will download the latest Apache security patch, extract it, and replace the existing Apache binaries with the patched binaries. Finally, the patch script will restart Apache.

It is important to note that this is just a sample patch script and may not work for all configurations. It is always best to consult with a security expert to ensure that your Apache installation is properly patched.
