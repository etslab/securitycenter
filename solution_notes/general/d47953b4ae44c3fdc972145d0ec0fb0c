**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Broken Access Control

**Issue:**
The DefaultOutboundAction policy setting in the Windows Firewall is not configured, allowing unauthorized outbound connections.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to configure the DefaultOutboundAction policy setting to "Block". This can be done using the following steps:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc).
2. Navigate to Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> Network Connections -> Windows Firewall -> Private Profile.
3. Double-click on the DefaultOutboundAction policy setting.
4. Select the "Enabled" radio button.
5. In the "Options" drop-down list, select "Block".
6. Click OK to save the changes.

**Additional Information:**
The Policy DefaultOutboundAction setting controls the default action taken by the Windows Firewall when a program tries to make an outbound connection. If this setting is not configured, the firewall will allow all outbound connections by default. This can be a security risk, as it can allow unauthorized programs to connect to the internet and send sensitive information.

Configuring the DefaultOutboundAction setting to "Block" will ensure that all outbound connections are blocked by default. This will help to protect your computer from unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
