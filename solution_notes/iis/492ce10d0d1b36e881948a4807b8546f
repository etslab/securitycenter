3. Click on the "HTTP Headers" icon in the Home pane.
4. Click on the "Add" button.
5. In the "Name" field, enter "X-Powered-By".
6. In the "Value" field, enter "off".
7. Click on the "OK" button.

**For IIS 8 and later:**

1. Open IIS Manager.
2. Select the website for which you want to disable the X-Powered-By header field.
3. Click on the "Request Headers" icon in the Home pane.
4. Click on the "Remove" button next to the "X-Powered-By" header field.
5. Click on the "OK" button.

**Note:** You may need to restart IIS for the changes to take effect.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to block requests that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
* Regularly update your web server software to patch any security vulnerabilities.
* Implement a security header policy (e.g., via HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) or Content Security Policy (CSP)) to protect against other information leakage vulnerabilities.
