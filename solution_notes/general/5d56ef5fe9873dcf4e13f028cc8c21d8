**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Identify the Blacklisted URLs:** Determine the specific URLs that have been blacklisted on the Apache server. This can be done by checking the server logs or configuration files.
2. **Verify the Blacklisted URLs:** Ensure that the URLs that are blacklisted are actually malicious or unwanted. This can be done by manually testing the URLs or using a web vulnerability scanner.
3. **Update Apache Configuration:** Edit the Apache configuration file (usually httpd.conf or apache2.conf) and add the following directives to block the blacklisted URLs:

   ```
   <Directory /path/to/webroot>
       Order deny,allow
       Deny from all
       Allow from 127.0.0.1
       # Add the blacklisted URLs here
       Deny from example.com
       Deny from another-example.com
   </Directory>
   ```

4. **Test the Changes:** Restart the Apache server and try to access the blacklisted URLs. They should now be blocked.
5. **Monitor and Review:** Regularly review the server logs and configuration files to ensure that the blacklisted URLs are still being blocked and that no new malicious URLs have been added.

**Additional Tips:**

* Consider using a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic and filter out potentially dangerous requests.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending excessive requests to your server.
* Keep the Apache server and its modules up to date with the latest security patches.
