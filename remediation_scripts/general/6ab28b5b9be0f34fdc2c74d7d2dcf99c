####patch script to remediate  CVE-2020-1934 in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2020-1934 in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then
  # Stop Apache
  sudo service httpd stop

  # Apply the patch
  sudo patch -p1 < CVE-2020-1934.patch

  # Start Apache
  sudo service httpd start
else
  echo "Apache is not running."
fi
```

This patch script will stop Apache, apply the patch, and then start Apache again. It is important to note that this patch script is only for Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41. If you are running a newer version of Apache, you will need to apply the patch that is provided by the Apache Software Foundation.

Here are the steps on how to apply the patch that is provided by the Apache Software Foundation:

1. Download the patch from the Apache Software Foundation website.
2. Unzip the patch file.
3. Change to the directory where the patch file was unzipped.
4. Run the following command to apply the patch:

```
patch -p1 < CVE-2020-1934.patch
```

5. Restart Apache.

```
sudo service httpd restart
```

After you have applied the patch, you should check the Apache HTTP Server documentation for any additional steps that you need to take to remediate the vulnerability.
