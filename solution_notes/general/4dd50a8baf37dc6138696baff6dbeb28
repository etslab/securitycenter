**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

1. **Update WordPress Core and Plugins:** Ensure that WordPress, the Yoast SEO plugin, and all other plugins and themes are up to date. Updates often include security patches that address vulnerabilities.

2. **Disable XML-RPC Interface:** The XML-RPC interface is designed for external applications to communicate with WordPress. However, it can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the site. Disable it by adding the following code to the `.htaccess` file:

```
<Files xmlrpc.php>
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
</Files>
```

3. **Disable the Yoast SEO API:** The Yoast SEO API can expose sensitive information about your website's content and configuration. Disable it by adding the following code to the `wp-config.php` file:

```
define('DISABLE_YOAST_SEO_API', true);
```

4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement 2FA for all administrator accounts to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can monitor and block malicious requests, including those targeting the WordPress-SEO plugin.

6. **Implement Security Headers:** Configure the following security headers to protect the website from common attacks:

   - Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
   - X-Content-Type-Options (X-CTO)
   - X-Frame-Options (X-FO)
   - X-XSS-Protection (X-XSS)

7. **Review and Harden File Permissions:** Ensure that WordPress files and directories have appropriate permissions to prevent unauthorized access.

8. **Regularly Scan for Vulnerabilities:** Use a vulnerability scanner to periodically scan the website for known vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.
