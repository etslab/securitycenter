**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Description:**

The Policy Kernel Object in Registry Object Access issue in Apache server occurs when the server's configuration allows unauthorized modification of registry keys or objects, which can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized control over the server.

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Restrict Registry Permissions:** Use Group Policy or registry editor to modify the permissions for the relevant registry keys to prevent unauthorized modification.

2. **Disable Inheritance:** Prevent the inheritance of permissions from parent registry keys to child keys.

3. **Use Least Privilege:** Ensure that only the necessary users and processes have access to the required registry keys.

4. **Implement Strong Authentication and Access Control:** Use strong authentication mechanisms and role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access to the registry.

5. **Regularly Audit and Monitor:** Regularly review registry permissions and audit system logs for suspicious activity related to registry modifications.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Keep Apache server and its components up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious requests targeting the registry.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor for unauthorized registry modifications.
