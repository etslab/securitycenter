####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 X-Content-Type-Options header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 X-Content-Type-Options header not implemented in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ $(pgrep httpd) ]; then

  # Check if the X-Content-Type-Options header is already set
  if ! grep -q "X-Content-Type-Options" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then

    # Add the X-Content-Type-Options header to Apache's configuration file
    echo "Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff" >> /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    # Restart Apache
    service apache2 restart

  fi

else

  echo "Apache is not running"

fi
```

This patch script will first check if Apache is running. If it is, the script will then check if the X-Content-Type-Options header is already set in Apache's configuration file. If it is not, the script will add the header to the configuration file and restart Apache.

The X-Content-Type-Options header is a security header that can be used to prevent certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. By setting this header, Apache will tell browsers not to allow content type sniffing, which is a technique that attackers can use to trick browsers into interpreting content as a different type than it actually is.

This patch script is a simple way to remediate CVE-2013-0169 and improve the security of your Apache web server.
