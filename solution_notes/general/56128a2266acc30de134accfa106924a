**Severity Assessment:** High

**Explanation:**
CVE-2016-0703 is a high-severity vulnerability that allows remote attackers to bypass access control restrictions in Apache HTTP Server versions 1.x and 2.x. The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow in the mod_negotiation module, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, update Apache HTTP Server to the latest version (currently 2.4.52 or later). Alternatively, you can disable the mod_negotiation module by editing the Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) and adding the following line:

```
LoadModule negotiation_module modules/mod_negotiation.so
```
