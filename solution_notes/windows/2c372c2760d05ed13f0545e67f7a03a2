**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A04: Insecure Design

**Problem:** The RpcProtocols policy is not set to the recommended value of "1", which disables the RPC over SMB protocol. This protocol is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and can be used to compromise the system.

**Solution:** Set the RpcProtocols policy to "1" by modifying the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers\RPC
```

Add or modify the DWORD value named "RpcProtocols" and set its value to "1".

**Additional Information:**

This issue is considered high severity because it allows an attacker to remotely compromise the system. The RPC over SMB protocol is no longer used by modern applications and should be disabled to improve security.
