**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 Category:** Broken Session Management

**Solution:**

1. **Enable HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt session cookies and prevent eavesdropping.

2. **Set Session Expiration Time:** Set a reasonable session expiration time to prevent stale sessions.

3. **Enable Secure Flags:** Set the `secure` flag on session cookies to prevent them from being transmitted over insecure connections.

4. **Set HttpOnly Flags:** Set the `HttpOnly` flag on session cookies to prevent them from being accessed by client-side scripts.

5. **Invalidate Old Sessions:** Invalidate previous session IDs when a user logs in or out to prevent session hijacking.

6. **Use a Session Management Library or Framework:** Utilize a trusted session management library or framework to handle session management securely.

7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection:** Implement CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent attackers from submitting requests on behalf of legitimate users.

8. **Session Fixation:** Prevent attackers from forcing a user to use a specific session ID by binding the session ID to the user's IP address or other unique identifier.

By implementing these measures, you can strengthen session management in your Apache server and address the identified audit issue.
