####patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie without SameSite Attribute in Apache HTTP Server
Sure, here is a patch script to remediate CVE-2013-0169, CWE-310 Cookie without SameSite Attribute in Apache HTTP Server:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if Apache is running
if [ "$(pgrep httpd)" ]; then
  echo "Apache is running. Stopping..."
  sudo service httpd stop
fi

# Patch the Apache configuration file
sudo sed -i 's/CookiePath \/ \/;/CookiePath \/; SameSite=Lax;/g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

# Restart Apache
sudo service httpd start

# Check if the patch was successful
if ! grep -q "SameSite=Lax" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf; then
  echo "The patch was not successful. Please check the configuration file."
  exit 1
fi

echo "The patch was successful. Apache is now patched against CVE-2013-0169."
```

This patch will add the `SameSite=Lax` attribute to all cookies set by Apache. This will prevent third-party cookies from being sent with cross-site requests, which mitigates the risk of CVE-2013-0169.

Please note that this is just a sample patch. You may need to make some adjustments to the patch depending on your specific Apache configuration.
