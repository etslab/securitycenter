###How to fix the Web Threats issue of Modern Web Application
There are a number of ways to fix the Web Threats issue of Modern Web Application in Apache web server. Some of the most effective methods include:

* **Using a web application firewall (WAF).** A WAF is a software application that sits between your web server and the internet. It can be used to filter out malicious traffic and prevent attacks.
* **Keeping your web server software up to date.** Software vendors often release security patches for known vulnerabilities. It is important to install these patches as soon as possible to protect your web server from attack.
* **Using strong passwords and security configurations.** Make sure that your web server passwords are strong and that you have configured your web server security settings correctly.
* **Educating your staff about web security.** Make sure that your staff are aware of the latest web security threats and how to protect themselves.

The Web Threats issue of Modern Web Application in Apache web server belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web 2021 category of **Broken Access Control**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to web applications. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to steal data, install malware, or disrupt service.

Here are some specific examples of how Broken Access Control vulnerabilities can be exploited:

* **SQL injection** is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into a web application. This code can then be used to steal data from the database or modify data in the database.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into a web application. This code can then be used to steal cookies, hijack sessions, or redirect users to malicious websites.
* **Directory traversal** is a vulnerability that allows attackers to access files and directories that they should not be able to access. This can be used to steal sensitive files or install malware.

By following the steps above, you can help to protect your Apache web server from the Web Threats issue.
