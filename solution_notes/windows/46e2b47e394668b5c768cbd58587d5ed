**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A05: Broken Access Control

**Solution:**

1. Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe).
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.
3. Locate the `NewAdministratorName` value and set it to a strong password.
4. Restart the server.

**Explanation:**

The Policy NewAdministratorName setting in the Registry System Access controls the password for the built-in Administrator account. A weak password for this account could allow an attacker to gain administrative access to the server. This is a high-severity issue because it could lead to the compromise of the entire server.

It is recommended to use a strong password for the Administrator account that is at least 12 characters long and contains a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. The password should also be unique and not used for any other accounts.
