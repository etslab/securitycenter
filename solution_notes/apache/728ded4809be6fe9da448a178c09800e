**Detailed Solution:**

The issue arises because the filepath package does not properly handle paths with a ?? prefix. This can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to access files or directories that should be restricted.

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Upgrade to the latest version of the filepath package (v1.16.0 or later).
2. Use the `filepath.Abs()` function to normalize paths before using them in your code. `filepath.Abs()` converts relative paths to absolute paths and resolves symbolic links.

**Example:**

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "path/filepath"
)

func main() {
    path := "??/tmp/secret.txt"

    // Normalize the path using filepath.Abs()
    absPath, err := filepath.Abs(path)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error normalizing path:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    // Use the normalized path
    fmt.Println("Normalized path:", absPath)
}
```

By normalizing paths using `filepath.Abs()`, you can prevent attackers from exploiting directory traversal vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

* The filepath package is used for manipulating file and directory paths in Go.
* Directory traversal vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can access files or directories outside the expected or restricted scope of an application.
