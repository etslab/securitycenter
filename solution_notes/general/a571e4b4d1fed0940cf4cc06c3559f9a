**Severity**: Medium

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category**: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Issue Description**:

The `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission allows an app to access the state of Wi-Fi and cellular networks. This permission is not typically required for normal app functionality and exposes sensitive information about the device's network connectivity.

**Solution**:

1. **Review the app's permissions**: Ensure that the app only requests permissions that are necessary for its core functionality.
2. **Conditional access**: Only grant the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission if the app requires it for specific tasks, such as connecting to a specific Wi-Fi network.
3. **Use an alternative permission**: Consider using the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission instead, which grants only basic network connectivity capabilities.
4. **Restrict network access**: Implement mechanisms to restrict the app's network access to specific domains or IP addresses.
5. **Use a trusted SDK**: If the app relies on a third-party SDK for network connectivity, ensure that the SDK is reputable and does not abuse the `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` permission.

**Additional Mitigation Measures**:

* Educate developers about the risks associated with unnecessary permissions.
* Establish a permission review process to ensure that new permissions are only granted when necessary.
* Regularly audit apps for unauthorized permissions and potential security vulnerabilities.
