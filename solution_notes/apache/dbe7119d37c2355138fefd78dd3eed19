**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** A3: Sensitive Data Exposure

**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Enable Policy Process Termination:**

   - Open the apache configuration file (`/etc/apache2/conf-available/modsecurity.conf`) with elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf-available/modsecurity.conf`).
   - Find the following line and change its value to 'On':
     ```
     SecRuleRemoveById 999508
     ```

2. **Restart Apache:**

   - Restart the Apache web server to apply the changes:
     ```
     sudo apache2ctl restart
     ```

**Explanation:**

Policy Process Termination allows ModSecurity to terminate the request processing process if a critical rule is triggered. This prevents sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) from being exposed in error messages or logs. By disabling this feature, an attacker could potentially exploit a vulnerability in the application and gain access to private data.

**Note:** This solution assumes you are using ModSecurity with Apache. If you are using a different web server or security module, the configuration steps may vary.
