###How to fix the Common Vulnerabilities issue of CVE-2016-10010 in nginx web server and which owasp top 10 web 2021 category this issue belong to ?
To fix the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) issue CVE-2016-10010 in the Nginx web server, you can follow these steps:

1. Update your Nginx installation to the latest version. The vulnerability was patched in version 1.6.2.
2. If you cannot update your Nginx installation, you can disable the use of forwarded Unix-domain sockets by setting the `daemon_user` directive to a non-root user.

CVE-2016-10010 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a local user to gain root access on a system running Nginx. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Nginx creates forwarded Unix-domain sockets as root, even if the web server is running as a non-root user. This allows a local user to exploit the vulnerability by creating a malicious file in a directory that is writable by the Nginx user. When Nginx attempts to open the malicious file, it will be able to escalate its privileges to root.

CVE-2016-10010 belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks category of "Execution of Unvalidated Code". This category includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

Here are some additional tips for securing your Nginx web server:

* Use a strong password for the Nginx user account.
* Enable authentication for access to the Nginx web server.
* Keep your Nginx installation up to date with the latest security patches.
* Use a firewall to restrict access to the Nginx web server.
* Monitor your Nginx web server for suspicious activity.
