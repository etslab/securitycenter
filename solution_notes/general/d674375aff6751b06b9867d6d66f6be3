**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Insecure Library or Framework

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the vulnerable version:** Determine which version of apktool_out/lib/arm64-v8a/libopvpnutil.so is installed on the Apache server and compare it to the latest secure version.
2. **Patch or update:** If the installed version is vulnerable, patch or update Apache server to the latest secure version. Ensure that the patch or update includes the fix for the vulnerability.
3. **Remove unnecessary libraries:** If the libopvpnutil.so library is not required by any essential applications, consider removing it from the server to reduce the attack surface.
4. **Secure library configurations:** If the library is necessary, ensure that its configuration and permissions are secure. Limit access to the library to only the necessary users and processes.
5. **Monitor for vulnerabilities:** Regularly monitor and scan Apache server for security vulnerabilities. Stay informed about any newly discovered vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates as necessary.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The vulnerability in libopvpnutil.so could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or DDoS attacks.
* It is crucial to address this vulnerability promptly to maintain the security and integrity of the server.
* Organizations should enforce a strict software update policy and regularly patch all their systems and applications to prevent such vulnerabilities from being exploited.
