## Severity Assessment

The use of DH Group 2 (RFC2409Oakley Group 2) in Apache Server is considered a **critical** security issue.

## OWASP Top 10 Category

This issue falls under **A05: Broken Access Control**.

## Detailed Solution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Generate a new DH group:** Generate a strong DH group using a secure key generation algorithm.
2. **Update Apache configuration:** Replace the existing DH group in Apache configuration with the new DH group. This can be done by modifying the `SSLParams` directive in the server configuration file.
3. **Restart Apache:** Restart the Apache server to apply the changes.

## Recommended DH Groups

It is recommended to use a DH group with a modulus size of at least 2048 bits. Some recommended DH groups include:

- `dhparam.pem` (2048-bit)
- `dh2048.pem` (2048-bit)
- `dh4096.pem` (4096-bit)

## Mitigation Measures

In addition to replacing the DH group, consider the following mitigation measures:

- **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** This forces browsers to only connect to the server over HTTPS.
- **Implement TLS 1.3:** Use the latest version of TLS for improved security.
- **Monitor for unauthorized access:** Regularly review server logs and audit access patterns for suspicious activity.
