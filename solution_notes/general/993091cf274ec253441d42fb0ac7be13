**Severity:** High

**OWASP Top 10 2021 Category:** Sensitive Data Exposure

**Solution:**

To fix this issue, you need to disable Policy Logoff in Registry Logon/Logoff in Apache server. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Apache httpd.conf file in a text editor.
2. Locate the following directive:
    ```
    EnableLogFiles stdout
    ```
3. Change the directive to:
    ```
    EnableLogFiles none
    ```
4. Save the file and restart the Apache server.

This will disable Policy Logoff in Registry Logon/Logoff and prevent the exposure of sensitive information in the server logs.
