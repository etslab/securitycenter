###How to fix the Certificates issue of Initial redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is to a different host preventing HSTS
The issue of initial redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is to a different host preventing HSTS in Apache web server can be fixed by following these steps:

1. Create a manual backup of your site.
2. Set up an HTTP to HTTPS redirect.
3. Add the HSTS header.
4. Submit your site to the HSTS preload list.
5. Verify your strict-transport-security header.

The following are the steps in detail:

1. Create a manual backup of your site. This is important in case something goes wrong during the fix process.
2. Set up an HTTP to HTTPS redirect. This can be done by adding the following code to your Apache configuration file:

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

3. Add the HSTS header. This can be done by adding the following code to your Apache configuration file:

```
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains;"
```

4. Submit your site to the HSTS preload list. This will add your site to a list of sites that browsers will always try to access over HTTPS. You can submit your site to the HSTS preload list here: https://hstspreload.org/

5. Verify your strict-transport-security header. You can verify that your site is correctly configured for HSTS by using the following command:

```
curl -I https://example.com | grep Strict-Transport-Security
```

If you see the following output, then your site is correctly configured for HSTS:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
```

The issue of initial redirection from HTTP to HTTPS is to a different host preventing HSTS in Apache web server belongs to the OWASP Top 10 Web Security 2021 category of **Injection**. This category includes vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application. In this case, the attacker could inject malicious code into the HTTP to HTTPS redirect, which could then be used to steal user credentials or other sensitive information.
