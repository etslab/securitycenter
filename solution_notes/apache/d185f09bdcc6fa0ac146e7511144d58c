**Solution:**

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Disable non-storable content in Apache:**
   - Open the Apache configuration file (usually named httpd.conf) using a text editor.
   - Locate the "AddType" directive and remove any entries for non-storable content types, such as:
     - AddType application/x-executable .exe .cgi
     - AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
   - Save and close the configuration file.

2. **Restart Apache:**
   - On Linux/Unix:
     - sudo systemctl restart httpd
   - On Windows:
     - Open the Services window (search for "Services" in the Start menu)
     - Locate the "Apache HTTP Server" service
     - Right-click and select "Restart"

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Use HTTPS:** Encrypting communication between the browser and server prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying content.
* **Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** This prevents browsers from connecting to the site over HTTP, even if the user types it in manually.
* **Implement rate limiting:** Restrict the number of requests from a single source to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **Patch Apache:** Keep Apache up to date with the latest security patches to fix vulnerabilities that could allow non-storable content to be uploaded.
